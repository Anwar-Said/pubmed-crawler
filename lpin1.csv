35222395,LPIN1 Is a Regulatory Factor Associated With Immune Response and Inflammation in Sepsis,"Abstract                        Objectives:                    Sepsis is a clinical disease that is typically treated in the intensive care unit, and the complex pathophysiology under this disease has not been thoroughly understood. While ferroptosis is involved in inflammation and infection, its effect in sepsis is still unknown. The study aimed to identify ferroptosis-related genes in sepsis, providing translational potential therapeutic targets.              Methods:                    The dataset GSE65682 was used to download the sample source from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to find suspected modules of sepsis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) most significantly associated with mortality were intersected with those altered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment and were further analyzed for the identification of main pathways of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The related pathway markers were further verified by qPCR.              Results:                    A total of 802 blood samples with sepsis were included for WGCNA, which identified 21 modules. Intersected with ferroptosis databases and LPS treatment groups, we identified two ferroptosis-related genes: PEBP1 and LPIN1. Only LPIN1 contributes to a poor outcome. Then, 205 DEGs were further identified according to the high or low LPIN1 expression. Among them, we constructed a gene regulatory network with several transcriptional factors using the NetworkAnalyst online tool and identified that these genes mostly correlate with inflammation and immune response. The immune infiltration analysis showed that lower expression of LPIN1 was related to macrophage infiltration and could be an independent predictor factor of the survival status in sepsis patients. Meanwhile, the multivariate Cox analysis showed that LPIN1 had a significant correlation with survival that was further verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments.              Conclusion:                    In conclusion, LPIN1 could become a reliable biomarker for patient survival in sepsis, which is associated with immune and inflammation status.              Keywords:                    LPIN1; NF-κB; immune infiltration; inflammation; sepsis."
34772856,LPIN1 is a new target gene for essential hypertension,"Abstract                        Background:                    We previously showed Lipin1 (LPIN1) to be a candidate gene for essential hypertension by genome-wide association studies. LPIN1 encodes the Lipin 1 protein, which contributes to the maintenance of lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. However, little is known about the association between LPIN1 and blood pressure (BP).              Methods:                    We evaluated the BP of LPIN1-deficient [fatty liver dystrophy (fld)] mice and explored related mechanisms.              Results:                    Fld mice have very low expression of LPIN1 and exhibit fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance and peripheral neuropathy. Fld mice had significantly elevated SBP and heart rate (HR) throughout the day as measured by a radiotelemetric method. Diurnal variation of SBP and HR was also absent in fld mice. Furthermore, urinary excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline by fld mice was significantly higher compared with that of control mice. The BP response of fld mice to clonidine (a centrally acting α2-adrenergic receptor agonist) was greater than that of control mice. However, levels of Angiotensinogen and Renin 1 mRNA and urinary nitric oxide excretion were comparable between the two groups. The decrease in SBP at 8 weeks after fat grafting surgery was significantly greater in the transplant group compared with the sham operated group.              Conclusion:                    The elevated BP in fld mice may result from activation of the sympathetic nervous system through decreased levels of adipose cytokines. These results indicate that LPIN1 plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation and that LPIN1 is a new target gene for essential hypertension."
33190588,TXNIP/VDUP1 attenuates steatohepatitis via autophagy and fatty acid oxidation,"Abstract:Impaired macroautophagy/autophagy has been implicated in experimental and human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the mechanism underlying autophagy dysregulation in NASH is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role and mechanism of TXNIP/VDUP1 (thioredoxin interacting protein), a key mediator of cellular stress responses, in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hepatic TXNIP expression was upregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients and in methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice, as well as in palmitic acid (PA)-treated hepatocytes. Upregulation of hepatic TXNIP was positively correlated with impaired autophagy, as evidenced by a decreased number of MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) puncta and increased SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) expression. Deletion of the Txnip gene enhanced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, accompanied by impaired autophagy and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in MCD diet-fed mice. Mechanistically, TXNIP directly interacted with and positively regulated p-PRKAA, leading to inactivation of MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) complex 1 (MTORC1) and nuclear translocation of TFEB (transcription factor EB), which in turn promoted autophagy. Inhibition of MTORC1 by rapamycin induced autophagy and increased the expression levels of FAO-related genes and concomitantly attenuated lipid accumulation in PA-treated txnip-knockout (KO) hepatocytes, which was further abolished by silencing of Atg7. Rapamycin treatment also attenuated MCD diet-induced steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis with increased TFEB nuclear translocation and restored FAO in txnip-KO mice. Our findings suggest that elevated TXNIP ameliorates steatohepatitis by interacting with PRKAA and thereby inducing autophagy and FAO. Targeting TXNIP may be a potential therapeutic approach for NASH.Abbreviations: ACOX1: acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 1, palmitoyl; ACSL1: acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1; ACTA2/α-SMA: actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle, aorta; ACTB: actin beta; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy-related; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; COL1A1/Col1α1: collagen, type I, alpha 1; CPT1A: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, liver; CQ: chloroquine; DGAT1: diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1; DGAT2: diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2; ECI2/Peci: enoyl-Coenzyme A isomerase 2; EHHADH: enoyl-Coenzyme A, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl Coenzyme A dehydrogenase; FAO: fatty acid oxidation; FASN: fatty acid synthase; FFA: free fatty acids; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GK/GYK: glycerol kinase; GOT1/AST: glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1, soluble; GPAM: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, mitochondrial; GPT/ALT: glutamic pyruvic transaminase, soluble; H&E: hematoxylin and eosin; IL1B/IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta; IL6: interleukin 6; IOD: integral optical density; KO: knockout; Leu: leupeptin; LPIN1: lipin 1; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MCD: methionine choline-deficient; MMP9: matrix metallopeptidase 9; mRNA: messenger RNA; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases; NASH: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; PA: palmitic acid; PPARA/PPARα: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; PPARG/PPARγ: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time PCR; RPS6KB1/p70S6K1: ribosomal protein S6 kinase, polypeptide 1; RPTOR: regulatory associated protein of MTOR complex 1; SCD1: stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1; SEM: standard error of the mean; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TG: triglyceride; TGFB/TGF-β: transforming growth factor, beta; TIMP1: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; TNF/TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; TXNIP/VDUP1: thioredoxin interacting protein; WT: wild-type.

34270928,FXR activation protects against NAFLD via bile-acid-dependent reductions in lipid absorption,"Abstract:FXR agonists are used to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in part because they reduce hepatic lipids. Here, we show that FXR activation with the FXR agonist GSK2324 controls hepatic lipids via reduced absorption and selective decreases in fatty acid synthesis. Using comprehensive lipidomic analyses, we show that FXR activation in mice or humans specifically reduces hepatic levels of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA). Decreases in MUFA are due to FXR-dependent repression of Scd1, Dgat2, and Lpin1 expression, which is independent of SHP and SREBP1c. FXR-dependent decreases in PUFAs are mediated by decreases in lipid absorption. Replenishing bile acids in the diet prevented decreased lipid absorption in GSK2324-treated mice, suggesting that FXR reduces absorption via decreased bile acids. We used tissue-specific FXR KO mice to show that hepatic FXR controls lipogenic genes, whereas intestinal FXR controls lipid absorption. Together, our studies establish two distinct pathways by which FXR regulates hepatic lipids.              Keywords:                    FXR; NAFLD; bile acids; intestinal lipid absorption."
35149744,LPIN1 promotes triglycerides synthesis and is transcriptionally regulated by PPARG in buffalo mammary epithelial cells,"Abstract:Studies on 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 hepatocytes have shown that phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase1 (LPIN1) plays a key role in adipogenesis, acting as a co-activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1a (PGC-1a) to regulate fatty acid metabolism. However, the functional role and regulatory mechanism of LPIN1 gene in milk fat synthesis of buffalo are still unknown. In this study, overexpression of buffalo LPIN1 gene transfected with recombinant fusion expression vector significantly increased the expression of AGPAT6, DGAT1, DGAT2, GPAM and BTN1A1 genes involved in triglyceride (TAG) synthesis and secretion, as well as PPARG and SREBF1 genes regulating fatty acid metabolism in the buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BMECs), while the lentivirus-mediated knockdown of buffalo LPIN1 dramatically decreased the relative mRNA abundance of these genes. Correspondingly, total cellular TAG content in the BMECs increased significantly after LPIN1 overexpression, but decreased significantly after LPIN1 knockdown. In addition, the overexpression or knockdown of PPARG also enhanced or reduced the expression of LPIN1 and the transcriptional activity of its promoter. The core region of buffalo LPIN1 promoter spans from - 666 bp to + 42 bp, and two PPAR response elements (PPREs: PPRE1 and PPRE2) were identified in this region. Site mutagenesis analysis showed that PPARG directly regulated the transcription of buffalo LPIN1 by binding to the PPRE1 and PPRE2 on its core promoter. The results here reveal that the LPIN1 gene is involved in the milk fat synthesis of BMECs, and one of the important pathways is to participate in this process through direct transcriptional regulation of PPARG, which in turn significantly affects the content of TAG in BMECs."
33946554,IL-33-Induced Transcriptional Activation of LPIN1 Accelerates Breast Tumorigenesis,"Abstract:Phospholipids are crucial materials that are not only required for cell membrane construction but also play significant roles as signaling molecules. LPIN1 is an enzyme that displays phosphatidate phosphatase activity in the triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis pathway. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of LPIN1 is involved in breast tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanism regulating LPIN1 expression has not been elucidated yet. In the present study, we showed that the IL-33-induced COT-JNK1/2 signaling pathway regulates LPIN1 mRNA and protein expression by recruiting c-Jun to the LPIN1 promoter in breast cancer cells. IL-33 dose-dependently and time-dependently increased LPIN1 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, IL-33 promoted colony formation and mammary tumorigenesis via induction of LPIN1 expression, while inhibition of LPIN1 disturbed IL-33-induced cell proliferation and mammary tumorigenesis. IL-33-driven LPIN1 expression was mediated by the COT-JNK1/2 signaling pathway, and inhibition of COT or JNK1/2 reduced LPIN1 expression. COT-JNK1/2-mediated IL-33 signaling activated c-Jun and promoted its binding to the promoter region of LPIN1 to induce LPIN1 expression. These findings demonstrated the regulatory mechanism of LPIN1 transcription by the IL-33-induced COT/JNK1/2 pathway for the first time, providing a potential mechanism underlying the upregulation of LPIN1 in cancer.              Keywords:                    COT; IL-33; JNK1/2; LPIN1; c-Jun."
35242575,LPIN1 rhabdomyolysis: A single site cohort description and treatment recommendations,"Abstract:Individuals with LPIN1 deficiency have early recurrent, life-threatening rhabdomyolysis but the full phenotypic spectrum and optimal treatment of the disorder remains unknown. Here we report the clinical details and treatment outcomes of 6 patients from our health system. The average age of presentation in our cohort was 23.8 months ±11.6 months (range 15-46 months). The average number of days for each hospitalization for this cohort is 11.7±13.2 days. Creatinine kinase (CK) levels peak during our care averaged 607,725 units/L (range 157,000-1,100,000 units/L). We observed that aspartate aminotransferase levels paralleled the CK levels in its elevation and resolution (Pearson's correlation R = 0.995); while alanine aminotransferase paralleled the elevation but lagged in the resolution of CK levels (R = 0.728). Unlike historical accounts, in our patient population, rhabdomyolysis was sometimes seen without inciting viral or traumatic events. We also cared for multiple individuals that had received treatment at other centers. This allowed us to compare multiple practice approaches and led to a standardized Care Recommendations.              Keywords:                    LPIN1; Rhabdomyolysis."
35565351,LPIN1 Induces Gefitinib Resistance in EGFR Inhibitor-Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells,"Abstract:Drug resistance limits the efficacy of targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); however, a substantial portion of the drug resistance mechanisms remains unexplained. In this study, we identified LPIN1 as a key factor that regulates gefitinib resistance in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Unlike TKI-sensitive HCC827 cells, gefitinib treatment induced LPIN1 expression and increased diacylglycerol concentration in TKI-resistant H1650 cells, followed by the activation of protein kinase C delta and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in an LPIN1-dependent manner, resulting in cancer cell survival. Additionally, LPIN1 increased the production of lipid droplets, which play an important role in TKI drug resistance. All results were recapitulated in a patient-derived EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line. In in vivo tumorigenesis assay, we identified that both shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmaceutical inhibition of LPIN1 clearly reduced tumor growth and confirmed that gefitinib treatment induced LPIN1 expression and LPIN1-dependent NF-κB activation (an increase in p-IκBα level) in tumor tissues. These results suggest an effective strategy of co-treating TKIs and LPIN1 inhibitors to prevent TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.

34602496,A 20-year Clinical and Genetic Neuromuscular Cohort Analysis in Lebanon: An International Effort,"Abstract                        Background:                    Clinical and molecular data on the occurrence and frequency of inherited neuromuscular disorders (NMD) in the Lebanese population is scarce.              Objective:                    This study aims to provide a retrospective overview of hereditary NMDs based on our clinical consultations in Lebanon.              Methods:                    Clinical and molecular data of patients referred to a multi-disciplinary consultation for neuromuscular disorders over a 20-year period (1999-2019) was reviewed.              Results:                    A total of 506 patients were diagnosed with 62 different disorders encompassing 10 classes of NMDs. 103 variants in 49 genes were identified. In this cohort, 81.4% of patients were diagnosed with motor neuron diseases and muscular dystrophies, with almost half of these described with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (40.3% of patients). We estimate a high SMA incidence of 1 in 7,500 births in Lebanon. Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy were the second most frequently diagnosed NMDs (17% of patients). These disorders were associated with the highest number of variants (39) identified in this study. A highly heterogeneous presentation of Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease was notably identified. The least common disorders (5.5% of patients) involved congenital, metabolic, and mitochondrial myopathies, congenital myasthenic syndromes, and myotonic dystrophies. A review of the literature for selected NMDs in Lebanon is provided.              Conclusions:                    Our study indicates a high prevalence and underreporting of heterogeneous forms of NMDs in Lebanon- a major challenge with many novel NMD treatments in the pipeline. This report calls for a regional NMD patient registry.              Keywords:                    CMT; DMD; FSHD; Genetics; LGMD; Lebanon; SMA; neuromuscular."
33274548,LPIN1 downregulation enhances anticancer activity of the novel HDAC/PI3K dual inhibitor FK-A11,"Abstract:Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor have been developed as potential anticancer drugs. However, the cytotoxicity of PI3K inhibitor or HDAC inhibitor alone is relatively weak. We recently developed a novel HDAC/PI3K dual inhibitor FK-A11 and confirmed its enhanced cytotoxicity when compared to that of PI3K inhibitor or HDAC inhibitor alone on several cancer cell lines. However, the in vivo antitumor activity of FK-A11 was insufficient. We conducted high-throughput RNA interfering screening and identified gene LPIN1 which enhances the cytotoxicity of FK-A11. Downregulation of LPIN1 enhanced simultaneous inhibition of HDAC and PI3K by FK-A11 and enhanced the cytotoxicity of FK-A11. Propranolol, a beta-adrenoreceptor which is also a LPIN1 inhibitor, enhanced the in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity and antitumor effect of FK-A11. These findings should help in the development of FK-A11 as a novel HDAC/PI3K dual inhibitor.              Keywords:                    LPIN1; dual HDAC/PI3K inhibitor; histone deacetylase; phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; propranolol."
27729374,LPIN1 promotes epithelial cell transformation and mammary tumourigenesis via enhancing insulin receptor substrate 1 stability,"Abstract:LPIN1 is a protein that exhibits dual functions as a phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzyme in regulation of triglyceride and glycerophospholipid metabolism and a transcriptional coregulator. Through unknown tumour-promoting mechanism, LPIN1 frequently observed in various human cancer cell lines controls main cellular processes involved in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that LPIN1 enhances the tumour-promoting function of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) by controlling IRS1 stability. LPIN1 interacts with IRS1 in an insulin growth factor-1-dependent signalling pathway and inhibits its serine phosphorylation, and thereby eliminating ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IRS1 via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Consequently, LPIN1 overexpression increases IRS1 abundance and enhances IRS1's ability to induce epithelial cell proliferation and mammary tumourigenesis. By contrast, depletion or inhibition of LPIN1 in breast cancer cells leads to a decreased IRS1 level, which subsequently inhibits the RAF1-mediated signalling pathway and AP-1 activity. In the syngeneic 4T1 breast cancer model, LPIN1 overexpression increased tumour development, whereas inhibition of LPIN1 and IRS1 suppressed it. Consistent with these observations, LPIN1 levels were positively correlated with IRS1 expression in human breast cancer. Thus, our results indicate a mechanism by which IRS1 expression is increased in breast cancer, and LPIN1 may be a promising drug target for anticancer therapy."
30986988,Genetic Effects of LPIN1 Polymorphisms on Milk Production Traits in Dairy Cattle,"Abstract:Our initial RNA sequencing work identified that lipin 1 (LPIN1) was differentially expressed during dry period, early lactation, and peak of lactation in dairy cows, and it was enriched into the fat metabolic Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways, thus we considered LPIN1 as the candidate gene for milk production traits. In this study, we detected the polymorphisms of LPIN1 and verified their genetic effects on milk yield and composition in a Chinese Holstein cow population. We found seven SNPs by re-sequencing the entire coding region and partial flanking region of LPIN1, including one in 5' flanking region, four in exons, and two in 3' flanking region. Of these, four SNPs, c.637T > C, c.708A > G, c.1521C > T, and c.1555A > C, in the exons were predicted to result in the amino acid replacements. With the Haploview 4.2, we found that seven SNPs in LPIN1 formed two haplotype blocks (D' = 0.98-1.00). Single-SNP association analyses showed that SNPs were significantly associated with milk yield, fat yield, fat percentage, or protein yield in the first or second lactation (p = < 0.0001-0.0457), and only g.86049389C > T was strongly associated with protein percentage in both lactations (p = 0.0144 and 0.0237). The haplotype-based association analyses showed that the two haplotype blocks were significantly associated with milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, or protein percentage (p = < 0.0001-0.0383). By quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that LPIN1 had relatively high expression in mammary gland and liver tissues. Furthermore, we predicted three SNPs, c.637T > C, c.708A > G, and c.1521C > T, using SOPMA software, changing the LPIN1 protein structure that might be potential functional mutations. In summary, we demonstrated the significant genetic effects of LPIN1 on milk production traits, and the identified SNPs could serve as genetic markers for dairy breeding.

20583302,LPIN1 gene mutations: a major cause of severe rhabdomyolysis in early childhood,"Abstract:Autosomal recessive LPIN1 mutations have been recently described as a novel cause of rhabdomyolysis in a few families. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of LPIN1 mutations in patients exhibiting severe episodes of rhabdomyolysis in infancy. After exclusion of primary fatty acid oxidation disorders, LPIN1 coding sequence was determined in genomic DNA and cDNA. Among the 29 patients studied, 17 (59%) carried recessive nonsense or frameshift mutations, or a large scale intragenic deletion. In these 17 patients, episodes of rhabdomyolysis occurred at a mean age of 21 months. Secondary defect of mitochondrial fatty oxidation or respiratory chain was found in skeletal muscle of two patients. The intragenic deletion, c.2295-866_2410-30del, was identified in 8/17 patients (47%), all Caucasians, and occurred on the background of a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. This deleted human LPIN1 form was unable to complement Delta pah1 yeast for growth on glycerol, in contrast to normal LPIN1. Since more than 50% of our series harboured LPIN1 mutations, LPIN1 should be regarded as a major cause of severe myoglobinuria in early childhood. The high frequency of the intragenic LPIN1 deletion should provide a valuable criterion for fast diagnosis, prior to muscle biopsy."
33425901,miR-429-3p/ LPIN1 Axis Promotes Chicken Abdominal Fat Deposition via PPARγ Pathway,"Abstract:To explore the regulatory mechanism of abdominal fat deposition in broilers, 100-day-old Sanhuang chickens (n = 12) were divided into high-fat and low-fat groups, according to the abdominal fat ratio size. Total RNA isolated from the 12 abdominal fat tissues was used for miRNA and mRNA sequencing. Results of miRNA and mRNA sequencing revealed that miR-429-3p was highly expressed in high-fat chicken whereas LPIN1 expression was downregulated. Further, we determined that miR-429-3p promoted preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, whereas LPIN1 exerted an opposite effect. Notably, we found that the miR-429-3p/LPIN1 axis facilitated PPARγ pathway activation, which is closely associated with the progression of adipogenesis. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that a novel miR-429-3p/LPIN1 axis is involved in the regulation of adipogenesis, which may have a guiding role in the improvement of breeding for abdominal fat traits in broiler chickens.

30718857,Extracellular matrix mechanical cues regulate lipid metabolism through Lipin-1 and SREBP,"Abstract:Extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanical cues have powerful effects on cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Here, starting from an unbiased metabolomics approach, we identify synthesis of neutral lipids as a general response to mechanical signals delivered by cell-matrix adhesions. Extracellular physical cues reverberate on the mechanical properties of the Golgi apparatus and regulate the Lipin-1 phosphatidate phosphatase. Conditions of reduced actomyosin contractility lead to inhibition of Lipin-1, accumulation of SCAP/SREBP to the Golgi apparatus and activation of SREBP transcription factors, in turn driving lipid synthesis and accumulation. This occurs independently of YAP/TAZ, mTOR and AMPK, and in parallel to feedback control by sterols. Regulation of SREBP can be observed in a stiffened diseased tissue, and contributes to the pro-survival activity of ROCK inhibitors in pluripotent stem cells. We thus identify a general mechanism centered on Lipin-1 and SREBP that links the physical cell microenvironment to a key metabolic pathway."
36195520,Two tales of LPIN1 deficiency: from fatal rhabdomyolysis to favorable outcome of acute compartment syndrome,"Abstract:LPIN1 deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease caused by biallelic mutations in LPIN1, where impaired fatty acid metabolism leads to stress in skeletal muscle, resulting in severe rhabdomyolysis, often triggered by fever, exercise, fasting, and anesthesia. It is the second most common cause of severe, recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis in early childhood which can result in serious morbidity and mortality. To date, 71 patients have been published in 20 clinical studies in the form of case series. We describe two previously unreported cases, one with a novel LPIN1 mutation that resulted in mortality, and another, to the best of our knowledge, with the first reported compartment syndrome managed with a favorable outcome in this disorder. Recognition of the complications including ventricular arrythmias, acute renal failure and compartment syndrome on the severe end of the spectrum may change the outcome and prognosis of this devastating condition.

32096176,MiRNA-584 suppresses the progression of ovarian cancer by negatively regulating LPIN1,"Abstract                        Objective:                    The aim of the study was to detect the expression level of microRNA-584 (miRNA-584) in ovarian cancer (OCa) and to elucidate its regulatory effect on OCa progression by regulating LPIN1.              Patients and methods:                    Expression levels of miRNA-584 and LPIN1 in 31 matched OCa tissues and paracancerous tissues were detected. The relationship of miRNA-584 level with clinical indicators and prognosis of OCa patients was analyzed. Influences of miRNA-584/LPIN1 regulatory loop on malignant phenotypes of OVCAR3 and PEO1 cells were assessed. In addition, the interaction between miRNA-584 and LPIN1 was confirmed by Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay and rescue experiments.              Results:                    MiRNA-584 was lowly expressed in OCa tissues, while LPIN1 was highly expressed. OCa patients expressing a low level of miRNA-584 suffered from higher rates of lymphatic metastasis and distant metastasis, as well as worse survival. The overexpression of miRNA-584 in OVCAR3 cells attenuated proliferative and migratory abilities, while the knockdown of miRNA-584 in PEO1 cells yielded the opposite results. LPIN1 was verified to be the target binding to miRNA-584 and its level was negatively regulated by miRNA-584. The overexpression of LPIN1 accelerated OCa cells to proliferate and migrate. Importantly, LPIN1 was responsible for OCa progression regulated by miRNA-584.              Conclusions:                    MiRNA-584 is downregulated in OCa tissues and cell lines. MiRNA-584 level is correlated with lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis in OCa patients. By negatively regulating LPIN1, miRNA-584 suppresses the malignant progression of OCa."
34078402,Identification of prognostic lipid droplet-associated genes in pancreatic cancer patients via bioinformatics analysis,"Abstract                        Background:                    Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States both in females and in males, and is projected to become the second deadliest cancer by 2030. The overall 5-year survival rate remains at around 10%. Cancer metabolism and specifically lipid metabolism plays an important role in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis. Lipid droplets can not only store and transfer lipids, but also act as molecular messengers, and signaling factors. As lipid droplets are implicated in reprogramming tumor cell metabolism and in invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells, we aimed to identify lipid droplet-associated genes as prognostic markers in pancreatic cancer.              Methods:                    We performed a literature search on review articles related to lipid droplet-associated proteins. To select relevant lipid droplet-associated factors, bioinformatics analysis on the GEPIA platform (data are publicly available) was carried out for selected genes to identify differential expression in pancreatic cancer versus healthy pancreatic tissues. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed regarding overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients.              Results:                    65 factors were identified as lipid droplet-associated factors. Bioinformatics analysis of 179 pancreatic cancer samples and 171 normal pancreatic tissue samples on the GEPIA platform identified 39 deferentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer with 36 up-regulated genes (ACSL3, ACSL4, AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, CAV2, CAVIN1, CES1, CIDEC, DGAT1, DGAT2, FAF2, G0S2, HILPDA, HSD17B11, ICE2, LDAH, LIPE, LPCAT1, LPCAT2, LPIN1, MGLL, NAPA, NCEH1, PCYT1A, PLIN2, PLIN3, RAB5A, RAB7A, RAB8A, RAB18, SNAP23, SQLE, VAPA, VCP, VMP1) and 3 down-regulated genes (FITM1, PLIN4, PLIN5). Among 39 differentially expressed factors, seven up-regulated genes (CAV2, CIDEC, HILPDA, HSD17B11, NCEH1, RAB5A, and SQLE) and two down-regulation genes (BSCL2 and FITM1) were significantly associated with overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified CAV2 as the only independent prognostic factor.              Conclusions:                    Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified nine prognostic relevant differentially expressed genes highlighting the role of lipid droplet-associated factors in pancreatic cancer.

34249899,Development and Validation of a Robust Ferroptosis-Related Prognostic Signature in Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Abstract                        Background:                    Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. Ferroptosis is a newly recognized process of cell death, which is different from other forms of cell death in morphology, biochemistry, and genetics, and has played a vital role in cancer biology. This study aimed to identify a ferroptosis-related gene signature associated with LUAD prognosis.              Methods:                    Dataset TCGA-LUAD which came from the TCGA portal was taken as the training cohort. GSE72094 and GSE68465 from the GEO database were treated as validation cohorts. Two hundred fifty-nine ferroptosis-related genes were retrieved from the FerrDb database. In the training cohort, Kaplan-Meier and univariate Cox analyses were conducted for preliminary screening of ferroptosis-related genes with potential prognostic capacity. These genes then entered into the LASSO Cox regression model, constructing a gene signature. The latter was then evaluated in the training and validation cohorts via Kaplan-Meier, Cox, and ROC analyses. In addition, the correlations between risk score and autophagy were examined by Pearson correlation coefficient. The analyses of GSEA and immune infiltrating were performed for better studying the function annotation of the gene signature and the character of each kind of immune cells played in the tumor microenvironment.              Results:                    A 15-gene signature was found from the training cohort and validated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, revealing its independent prognosis value in LUAD. Moreover, the ROC analysis was conducted, confirming a strong predictive ability that this signature owned for LUAD prognosis. One hundred fifty-one of 222 (68.01%) autophagy-related genes were discovered significantly correlated with risk scores. Analyses of GSEA and immune infiltration exhibited in detail the specific pathways that associate with the 15-gene signature and identified the crucial roles of resting mast cells and resting dendritic cells owned in the prognosis of the 15-gene signature.              Conclusion:                    In this present study, a novel ferroptosis-related 15-gene signature (RELA, ACSL3, YWHAE, EIF2S1, CISD1, DDIT4, RRM2, PANX1, TLR4, ARNTL, LPIN1, HERPUD1, NCOA4, PEBP1, and GLS2) was built. It could accurately predict the prognosis of LUAD and was related to resting mast cells and resting dendritic cells, which provide potential for the personalized outcome prediction and the development of new therapies in LUAD population.

32115342,A rare case of adult onset LPIN1 associated rhabdomyolysis,"Abstract:Pathogenic variants in LPIN1 are a recognised cause of severe and often fatal rhabdomyolysis in childhood. We present a rare case of adult onset recurrent rhabdomyolysis due to compound heterozygous variants in LPIN1. Despite first presenting with rhabdomyolysis in his twenties and having undergone extensive investigations, the patient did not receive a diagnosis until he was 46 years of age. DNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic deletion involving exon 18 of LPIN1 in conjunction with a c.2410G>A missense variant in exon 19. Whilst LPIN1 variants are a noteworthy cause of severe recurrent rhabdomyolysis in childhood, this is the first detailed description and only the second reported case of adult onset rhabdomyolysis. Variants in LPIN1 should be considered as a cause of recurrent severe rhabdomyolysis in adults when other more common causes have been excluded.              Keywords:                    Exercise; Fasting; LPIN1; Lipin-1; Myopathy; Rhabdomyolysis."
32522502,First presentation of LPIN1 acute rhabdomyolysis in adolescence and adulthood,"Abstract:LPIN1 mutations are a known common cause of autosomal recessive, recurrent and life-threatening acute rhabdomyolysis of childhood-onset. The first episode of rhabdomyolysis usually happens in nearly all cases before the age of 5 and death is observed in 1/3 of patients. Here we present two cases of acute rhabdomyolysis with a milder phenotype caused by LPIN1 mutation presenting in adolescence (11 years old) and adulthood (40 years old) after Parvovirus infection and metabolic stress, respectively. In our opinion, the mutation types, epigenetic factors, the environment exposition to triggers or the existence of proteins with a similar structure of LPIN1, may have a role in modulating the onset of rhabdomyolysis. LPIN1 should be included on a panel of genes analysed in the investigation of adult individuals with rhabdomyolysis. Metabolic and viral stressors should be included in the list of possible rhabdomyolysis precipitant.              Keywords:                    Adult; LPIN1; Next generation sequencing; Rhabdomyolysis."
21715287,A hypomorphic mutation in Lpin1 induces progressively improving neuropathy and lipodystrophy in the rat,"Abstract:The Lpin1 gene encodes the phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1) enzyme Lipin 1, which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism. In this study we describe the identification and characterization of a rat model with a mutated Lpin1 gene (Lpin1(1Hubr)), generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Lpin1(1Hubr) rats are characterized by hindlimb paralysis and mild lipodystrophy that are detectable from the second postnatal week. Sequencing of Lpin1 identified a point mutation in the 5'-end splice site of intron 18 resulting in mis-splicing, a reading frameshift, and a premature stop codon. As this mutation does not induce nonsense-mediated decay, it allows the production of a truncated Lipin 1 protein lacking PAP1 activity. Lpin1(1Hubr) rats developed hypomyelination and mild lipodystrophy rather than the pronounced demyelination and adipocyte defects characteristic of Lpin1(fld/fld) mice, which carry a null allele for Lpin1. Furthermore, biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses revealed that these lesions improve in older Lpin1(1Hubr) rats as compared with young Lpin1(1Hubr) rats and Lpin1(fld/fld) mice. We observed activation of compensatory biochemical pathways substituting for missing PAP1 activity that, in combination with a possible non-enzymatic Lipin 1 function residing outside of its PAP1 domain, may contribute to the less severe phenotypes observed in Lpin1(1Hubr) rats as compared with Lpin1(fld/fld) mice. Although we are cautious in making a direct parallel between the presented rodent model and human disease, our data may provide new insight into the pathogenicity of recently identified human LPIN1 mutations."
19543209,The associations of LPIN1 gene expression in adipose tissue with metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population,"Abstract:The LPIN1 gene, encoding lipin-1 protein, plays critical roles in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. This study aimed to analyze the association of LPIN1 mRNA levels in human adipose tissue with metabolic phenotypes. We also examined the association of LPIN1 genetic variation with type 2 diabetes and related metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population. The relative LPIN1 mRNA levels were measured in abdominal visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) obtained from 102 nondiabetic Chinese females. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning from the 5'-upstream region to the 3'-end of the LPIN1 gene were genotyped in 1,520 Chinese (760 type 2 diabetic cases and 760 controls). LPIN1 mRNA levels in VAT were negatively correlated with BMI (r = -0.21, P = 0.03), body fat percentage (r = -0.22, P = 0.02), plasma triglycerides levels (r = -0.21, P = 0.03), and plasma leptin levels (r = -0.63, P = 0.0002). LPIN1 mRNA levels were positively correlated with PPARG and ADIPOQ mRNA levels in both VAT and SAT. No single SNP of the LPIN1 gene was associated with type 2 diabetes in our population. One rare haplotype showed a significant association with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR), 4.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-11.75; P = 4 x 10(-4)). No SNP or haplotype of the LPIN1 gene was associated with quantitative metabolic traits in the nondiabetic subjects. The results confirmed the association of LPIN1 gene expression in adipose tissue with lower adiposity and favorable metabolic profiles in the Chinese population. However, the LPIN1 gene seemed not to be a major susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes or related metabolic phenotypes in the Chinese population."
23031312,Identification of the transcript isoforms and expression characteristics for chicken Lpin1,"Abstract:Lpin1 was a gene with important effects on controlling lipid/energy metabolism in humans and mice. However, little was known about chicken Lpin1 gene. In the present study, two transcript isoforms of chicken Lpin1 were identified. Lpin1-α was predicted encoding one 902 amino acid protein, whereas Lpin1-δ was predicted encoding one 918 amino acid protein with an insertion of 48-bp fragment from intron 12 of chicken Lpin1-α, and a conservative element was found to be located in intron 12 of chicken Lpin1-α genomic sequence. Ten variants were identified from chicken Lpin1-α coding sequence, and two missense mutations were predicted to affect the protein function of Lpin1. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that chicken total Lpin1, Lpin1-α and Lpin1-δ were expressed in all analyzed tissues, and presented clear tissue expression differences. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed that 30% energy restriction significantly elevated the total Lpin1 mRNA expression level in hepatic (P < 0.01) and adipose (P < 0.01) tissues of birds. Chicken total Lpin1 gene mRNA expression level presented a significantly inverse correlation with some traits including abdominal fat rate (P < 0.01), serum high-density lipoprotein (P < 0.05) and total cholesterol (P < 0.05), which would make a foundation for the further study on chicken Lpin1 gene function."

36941958,Use of dexamethasone in acute rhabdomyolysis in LPIN1 deficiency,"Abstract                        Introduction:                    LPIN1 deficiency is an autosomal recessive form of early childhood recurrent severe rhabdomyolysis. Although not completely lucid yet, LPIN1 has been shown to modulate endosomal-related pro-inflammatory responses via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Treatment with anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone has been proposed to improve the outcome.              Case:                    We report a male toddler with recurrent episodes of complicated rhabdomyolysis, requiring prolonged intensive care unit admissions. Whole exome sequencing revealed a common homozygous 1.7 kb intragenic deletion in LPIN1. Despite optimal metabolic cares, the patient presented with an extremely high CK level where he benefited from intravenous dexamethasone (0.6 mg/Kg/day) for a period of 6 days.              Results:                    Dexamethasone administration shortened the course of active rhabdomyolysis, intensive care admission and rehabilitation. It also prevented rhabdomyolysis-related complications such as kidney injury and compartment syndrome.              Conclusion:                    Our patient showed a favorable response to parenteral dexamethasone, in addition to hyperhydration with IV fluids, sufficient calorie intake, and restricted dietary fat. The improvement with corticosteroids suggests an uncontrolled inflammatory response as the pathophysiology of LPIN1 deficiency.

23266642,Distinct tissue expression profiles of chicken Lpin1-α/β isoforms and the effect of the variation on muscle fiber traits,"Abstract:Here we cloned chicken Lpin1-β, conducted the temporal and spatial expression pattern analysis of chicken Lpin1 isoforms by real-time PCR, and studied the 5' flanking region variation and the potential effect. It was found that chicken Lpin1-α and Lpin1-β exhibited distinct tissue expression profiling, with prominent expression in the ovary and muscle tissues respectively. Chicken Lpin1 presented a tissue-specific temporal expression pattern in postnatal development (0-16 weeks). Energy restriction significantly elevated the mRNA level of total Lpin1 by increasing the expression of Lpin1-α and Lpin1-β in a nearly same magnitude. Eight variants/four haplotypes among six breeds were detected from the 5' flanking region of chicken Lpin1, one multiple-nucleotide length polymorphism (g.258M>N) was found and predicted causing the change of 31 transcription factor binding sites including MyoD et al. Both g.258M>N and g. 65C>T variants showed significant association with muscle fiber traits, which suggested one novel role of Lpin1 on muscle fiber development."
20530740,Lpin1 in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue: similar levels but different associations with lipogenic and lipolytic genes,"Abstract:LPIN1 is a gene with important effects on lipidic and metabolic homeostasis. Human subcutaneous LPIN1 expression levels in adipose tissue are related with a better metabolic profile, including insulin sensitivity markers. However, there are few data on the regulation of LPIN1 in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Our aim was to perform a cross-sectional analysis of VAT compared with subcutaneous (SAT) LPIN1 expression in a well-characterized obese cohort, its relation with the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, and the in vitro response to lipogenic and lipolytic stimuli. A downregulation of total LPIN1 mRNA expression in subjects with obesity was found in VAT similarly to that in SAT. Despite similar total LPIN1 mRNA levels in SAT and VAT, a close relationship with clinical parameters and with many lipogenic and lipolytic genes was observed primarily in SAT depot. As shown in the in vitro analysis, the low-grade proinflammatory environment and the insulin resistance associated with obesity may contribute to downregulate LPIN1 in adipose tissue, leading to a worse metabolic profile."
18591397,"Evaluating the role of LPIN1 variation in insulin resistance, body weight, and human lipodystrophy in U.K. Populations","Abstract                        Objective:                    Loss of lipin 1 activity causes lipodystrophy and insulin resistance in the fld mouse, and LPIN1 expression and common genetic variation were recently suggested to influence adiposity and insulin sensitivity in humans. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive association study to clarify the influence of common LPIN1 variation on adiposity and insulin sensitivity in U.K. populations and to examine the role of LPIN1 mutations in insulin resistance syndromes.              Research design and method:                    Twenty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging common LPIN1 variation were genotyped in Medical Research Council (MRC) Ely (n = 1,709) and Hertfordshire (n = 2,901) population-based cohorts. LPIN1 exons, exon/intron boundaries, and 3' untranslated region were sequenced in 158 patients with idiopathic severe insulin resistance (including 23 lipodystrophic patients) and 48 control subjects.              Results:                    We found no association between LPIN1 single nucleotide polymorphisms and fasting insulin but report a nominal association between rs13412852 and BMI (P = 0.042) in a meta-analysis of 8,504 samples from in-house and publicly available studies. Three rare nonsynonymous variants (A353T, R552K, and G582R) were detected in severely insulin-resistant patients. However, these did not cosegregate with disease in affected families, and Lipin1 protein expression and phosphorylation in patients with variants were indistinguishable from those in control subjects.              Conclusions:                    Our data do not support a major effect of common LPIN1 variation on metabolic traits and suggest that mutations in LPIN1 are not a common cause of lipodystrophy in humans. The nominal associations with BMI and other metabolic traits in U.K. cohorts require replication in larger cohorts."
31786011,Rewiring Neuronal Glycerolipid Metabolism Determines the Extent of Axon Regeneration,"Abstract:How adult neurons coordinate lipid metabolism to regenerate axons remains elusive. We found that depleting neuronal lipin1, a key enzyme controlling the balanced synthesis of glycerolipids through the glycerol phosphate pathway, enhanced axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Axotomy elevated lipin1 in retinal ganglion cells, which contributed to regeneration failure in the CNS by favorably producing triglyceride (TG) storage lipids rather than phospholipid (PL) membrane lipids in neurons. Regrowth induced by lipin1 depletion required TG hydrolysis and PL synthesis. Decreasing TG synthesis by deleting neuronal diglyceride acyltransferases (DGATs) and enhancing PL synthesis through the Kennedy pathway promoted axon regeneration. In addition, peripheral neurons adopted this mechanism for their spontaneous axon regeneration. Our study reveals a critical role of lipin1 and DGATs as intrinsic regulators of glycerolipid metabolism in neurons and indicates that directing neuronal lipid synthesis away from TG synthesis and toward PL synthesis may promote axon regeneration.              Keywords:                    DGAT1; DGAT2; Lipin1; axon regeneration; glycerolipid; phospholipid; retinal ganglion cell; triglyceride."
18581256,Investigation of Lpin1 as a candidate gene for fat deposition in pigs,"Abstract:Lpin1 deficiency prevents normal adipose tissue development and remarkably reduces adipose tissue mass, while overexpression of the Lpin1 gene in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue promotes adiposity in mice. However, little is known about the porcine Lpin1 gene. In the present study, a 5,559-bp cDNA sequence of the porcine Lpin1 gene was obtained by RT-PCR and 3'RACE. The sequence consisted of a 111-bp 5'UTR, a 2,685-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 894 amino acids and a 2,763-bp 3'UTR. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that Lpin1 had a high level of expression in the liver, spleen, skeletal muscle and fat, a low level of expression in the heart, lung and kidney. The porcine Lpin1 gene was assigned to 3q21-27 by using the somatic cell hybrid panel (SCHP) and the radiation hybrid (IMpRH) panel. One C93T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified and genotyped using the TaqI PCR-RFLP method. Association analysis between the genotypes and fat deposition traits suggested that different genotypes of the Lpin1 gene were associated with percentage of leaf fat and intramuscular fat."
33160098,m6A Regulates Liver Metabolic Disorders and Hepatogenous Diabetes,"Abstract:N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant modifications on mRNAs and plays important roles in various biological processes. The formation of m6A is catalyzed by a methyltransferase complex (MTC) containing a key factor methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3). However, the functions of Mettl3 and m6A modification in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism remain unclear. Here, we showed that both Mettl3 expression and m6A level increased in the livers of mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorders. Overexpression of Mettl3 aggravated HFD-induced liver metabolic disorders and insulin resistance. In contrast, hepatocyte-specific knockout of Mettl3 significantly alleviated HFD-induced metabolic disorders by slowing weight gain, reducing lipid accumulation, and improving insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, Mettl3 depletion-mediated m6A loss caused extended RNA half-lives of metabolism-related genes, which consequently protected mice against HFD-induced metabolic syndrome. Our findings reveal a critical role of Mettl3-mediated m6A in HFD-induced metabolic disorders and hepatogenous diabetes.

26909335,Molecular analysis of LPIN1 in Jordanian patients with rhabdomyolysis,"Abstract:Recessive mutations in LPIN1, which encodes a phosphatidate phosphatase enzyme, are a frequent cause of severe rhabdomyolysis in childhood. Hence, we sequenced the 19 coding exons of the gene in eight patients with recurrent hereditary myoglobinuria from four unrelated families in Jordan. The long-term goal is to facilitate molecular genetic diagnosis without the need for invasive procedures such as muscle biopsies. Three different mutations were detected, including the novel missense mutation c.2395G>C (Gly799Arg), which was found in two families. The two other mutations, c.2174G>A (Arg725His) and c.1162C>T (Arg388X), have been previously identified, and were found to cosegregate with the disease phenotype in the other two families. Intriguingly, patients homozygous for Arg725His were also homozygous for the c.1828C>T (Pro610Ser) polymorphism, and were exercise-intolerant between myoglobinuria episodes. Notably, patients homozygous for Arg388X were also homozygous for the c.2250G>C silent variant (Gly750Gly). Taken together, the data provide family-based evidence linking hereditary myoglobinuria to pathogenic variations in the C-terminal lipin domain of the enzyme. This finding highlights the functional significance of this domain in the absence of structural information. This is the first analysis of LPIN1 in myoglobinuria patients of Jordanian origin, and the fourth such analysis worldwide.               Keywords:                    C-LIP domain; Lipin-1; myoglobinuria."
22157924,LPIN1 rs13412852 polymorphism in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Abstract                        Objectives:                    The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the lipin1 rs13412852 C>T polymorphism is associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis in pediatric Italian patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).              Methods:                    A total of 142 untreated, consecutive children and 115 adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD and 337 healthy controls without steatosis were studied. Liver histology was assessed by the NAFLD activity score and the rs13412852 polymorphism by a 5' nuclease Taqman assay.              Results:                    Homozygosity for the rs13412852 T allele was underrepresented in pediatric, but not adult, patients with NAFLD compared with healthy controls (7% vs 14%; odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.91), and it was associated with lower triglycerides both in pediatric patients and healthy controls (P ≤ 0.01). Affected children carrying the rs13412852 TT genotype had a trend for a lower prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and significantly less severe liver damage, as indicated by NAFLD activity score severity (P = 0.026) and a lower prevalence of liver fibrosis (P = 0.012). The negative association between rs13412852 TT genotype and fibrosis was independent of Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing-3 genotype and other clinical risk factors, including age, waist circumference, the presence of hyperglycemia, and alanine transaminase levels (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.11-0.66), and it was confirmed at multivariate analysis in adults (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.02-0.67).              Conclusions:                    Lipin1 rs13412852 single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with the severity of liver damage and fibrosis progression in pediatric patients with histological NAFLD."
36105394,Identification of ferroptosis-associated biomarkers for the potential diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis,"Abstract                        Objective:                    Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is one of the most commonly occurring conditions worldwide and is characterized by estrogen deficiency as well as persistent calcium loss with age. The aim of our study was to identify significant ferroptosis-associated biomarkers for PMOP.              Methods and materials:                    We obtained our training dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using GSE56815 expression profiling data. Meanwhile, we extracted ferroptosis-associated genes for further analysis. Differentially expressed ferroptosis-associated genes (DEFAGs) between OP patients and normal controls were selected using the ""limma"" package. We established a ferroptosis-associated gene signature using training models, specifically, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models. It was further validated in another dataset (GSE56814) which also showed a high AUC: 0.98, indicating high diagnostic value. Using consensus clustering, the OP patient subtypes were identified. A ferroptosis associated gene (FAG)-Scoring scheme was developed by PCA. The important candidate genes associated with OP were also compared between different ferrclusters and geneclusters.              Results:                    There were significant DEFAGs acquired, of which five (HMOX1, HAMP, LPIN1, MAP3K5, FLT3) were selected for establishing a ferroptosis-associated gene signature. Analyzed from the ROC curve, our established RF model had a higher AUC value than the SVM model (RF model AUC:1.00). Considering these results, the established RF model was chosen to be the most appropriate training model. Later, based on the expression levels of the five DEFAGs, a clinical application nomogram was established. The OP patients were divided into two subtypes (ferrcluster A, B and genecluster A, B, respectively) according to the consensus clustering method based on DEFAGs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Ferrcluster B and genecluster B had higher ferroptosis score than ferrcluster A and genecluster A, respectively. The expression of COL1A1 gene was significantly higher in ferrcluster B and gencluster B compared with ferrcluster A and gencluster A, respectively, while there is no statistical difference in term of VDR gene, COL1A2 genes, and PTH gene expressions between ferrcluster A and B, together with gencluster A and B.              Conclusions:                    On the basis of five explanatory variables (HMOX1, HAMP, LPIN1, MAP3K5 and FLT3), we developed a diagnostic ferroptosis-associated gene signature and identified two differently categorized OP subtypes that may potentially be applied for the early diagnosis and individualized treatment of PMOP. The ER gene, VDR gene, IL-6 gene, COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, and PTH gene are important candidate gene of OP, however, more studies are still anticipated to further elucidate the relationship between these genes and ferroptosis in OP.              Keywords:                    biomarker; candidate genes; consensus clustering; ferroptosis; postmenopausal osteoporosis."
21816276,mTOR complex 1 regulates lipin 1 localization to control the SREBP pathway,"Abstract:The nutrient- and growth factor-responsive kinase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates many processes that control growth, including protein synthesis, autophagy, and lipogenesis. Through unknown mechanisms, mTORC1 promotes the function of SREBP, a master regulator of lipo- and sterolgenic gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 regulates SREBP by controlling the nuclear entry of lipin 1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase. Dephosphorylated, nuclear, catalytically active lipin 1 promotes nuclear remodeling and mediates the effects of mTORC1 on SREBP target gene, SREBP promoter activity, and nuclear SREBP protein abundance. Inhibition of mTORC1 in the liver significantly impairs SREBP function and makes mice resistant, in a lipin 1-dependent fashion, to the hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia induced by a high-fat and -cholesterol diet. These findings establish lipin 1 as a key component of the mTORC1-SREBP pathway."
18693052,LPIN1 genetic variation is associated with rosiglitazone response in type 2 diabetic patients,"Abstract:Lipin1 protein, a product of the LPIN1 gene, is required for normal adipose tissue development and metabolism. Lipin1 deficiency results in immature adipocyte development in cases of mouse fatty liver dystrophy and human lipodystrophy. Recently, pioglitazone has been reported to increase human adipocyte lipin1 expression. We evaluated the effects of LPIN1 polymorphisms on rosiglitazone response in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A total of 262 patients were treated with 12 weeks of rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) in addition to their previous drug regimen medications. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the LPIN1 locus were genotyped: rs11693809, rs10192566, rs2278513, rs2577262, rs2716610, and rs1050800. Because rs11693809, rs10192566, and rs2278513 are in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium (D'>0.958, r(2) >0.882), we analyzed rs10192566, rs2577262, rs2716610, and rs1050800. Rs10192566 was significantly associated with rosiglitazone treatment response. Patients with the G allele in rs10192566 had a larger decrease in fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial glucose, and HbA1c than those without. This genetic effect remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and initial body weight. No other SNPs were associated with response. These data suggest that LPIN1 genetic variations can affect rosiglitazone treatment response in T2DM."
26111941,A novel therapeutic approach for LPIN1 mutation-associated rhabdomyolysis--The Austrian experience,"Abstract                        Introduction:                    Lipin 1 gene (LPIN1) mutations lead to cellular energy deficiency and cause up to 50% of the rhabdomyolysis episodes seen in pediatric patients. These episodes are associated with poor prognosis, as treatment options have been limited. We propose a novel therapeutic strategy based on prevention and early treatment of catabolism.              Methods:                    Five patients were diagnosed with LPIN1 mutations. They were instructed to maintain high caloric intake in situations possibly leading to catabolism such as viral infections or excessive physical activity. When an episode of rhabdomyolysis occurred, patients were treated with intravenous high-concentration glucose at first symptoms.              Results:                    The therapeutic strategies described limited the number of rhabdomyolyis episodes, and the duration of episodes was reduced from 7-10 days, as reported in the literature, to 5 days.              Conclusion:                    In this small series, patients with LPIN1 mutations appear to have benefited from prevention and early treatment of catabolism.

19793967,Concurrent Lpin1 and Nrcam mouse mutations result in severe peripheral neuropathy with transitory hindlimb paralysis,"Abstract:Peripheral neuropathy is a broad category of disorders with a diverse etiology, grouped together by their common pathogenic effect on the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Because of the heterogeneity observed to be responsible for these disorders, a forward genetics method of gene discovery was used to identify additional affected pathways. In this report, we describe the mutant mouse line 20884, generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, which is characterized by adult-onset transitory hindlimb paralysis. Linkage mapping revealed that two point mutations are responsible for the phenotype: a partial loss-of-function mutation in the gene for phosphatidate phosphatase Lpin1 and a truncation mutation in the gene that encodes the neuronal cell adhesion molecule NrCAM. To investigate how the 20884 Lpin1 and Nrcam mutations interact to produce the paralysis phenotype, the double mutant and both single mutants were analyzed by quantitative behavioral, histological, and electrophysiological means. The Lpin1(20884) mutant and the double mutant are characterized by similar levels of demyelination and aberrant myelin structures. Nevertheless, the double mutant exhibits more severe electrophysiological abnormalities than the Lpin1(20884) mutant. The Nrcam(20884) mutant is characterized by normal sciatic nerve morphology and a mild electrophysiological defect. Comparison of the double mutant phenotype with the two single mutants does not point to an additive relationship between the two defects; rather, the Lpin1(20884) and Nrcam(20884) defects appear to act synergistically to produce the 20884 phenotype. It is proposed that the absence of NrCAM in a demyelinating environment has a deleterious effect, possibly by impairing the process of remyelination."
33599498,MiR-99b-5p Attenuates Adipogenesis by Targeting SCD1 and Lpin1 in 3T3-L1 Cells,"Abstract:The number and distribution of adipocytes directly affect the quality of livestock meat products. The analysis of the adipogenesis mechanism is the basis for improving meat quality. The formation of adipocytes is regulated by many factors, including a class of endogenous small RNAs, named microRNA (miRNA). Previous studies have shown that miRNAs could affect adipogenesis by post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. In our study, a decreased miR-99b-5p expression level was found in the adipose tissue of obese mice. Overexpression of miR-99b-5p could increase cell proliferation by promoting the cell cycle while inhibiting cell differentiation. In addition, interference with miR-99b-5p obtained the opposite result. Furthermore, the proteomics sequencing analysis screened 1154 differentially expressed proteins, which are closely related to adipocyte differentiation and fatty acid metabolism. In addition, the results of the dual-luciferase test showed that miR-99b-5p can directly target the proteins SCD1 and Lpin1 with significantly different expression levels in proteomic sequencing. Then, this result was verified at the level of mRNA and protein in a further study. Collectively, these results suggested that miR-99b-5p may be a target for improving meat quality.

22481384,"Study of LPIN1, LPIN2 and LPIN3 in rhabdomyolysis and exercise-induced myalgia","Abstract                        Background:                    Recessive LPIN1 mutations were identified as a cause of severe rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients. The human lipin family includes two other closely related members, lipin-2 and 3, which share strong homology and similar activity. The study aimed to determine the involvement of the LPIN family genes in a cohort of pediatric and adult patients (n = 171) presenting with muscular symptoms, ranging from severe (CK >10 000 UI/L) or moderate (CK <10 000 UI/L) rhabdomyolysis (n = 141) to exercise-induced myalgia (n = 30), and to report the clinical findings in patients harboring mutations.              Methods:                    Coding regions of LPIN1, LPIN2 and LPIN3 genes were sequenced using genomic or complementary DNAs.              Results:                    Eighteen patients harbored two LPIN1 mutations, including a frequent intragenic deletion. All presented with severe episodes of rhabdomyolysis, starting before age 6 years except two (8 and 42 years). Few patients also suffered from permanent muscle symptoms, including the eldest ones (≥ 40 years). Around 3/4 of muscle biopsies showed accumulation of lipid droplets. At least 40% of heterozygous relatives presented muscular myalgia. Nine heterozygous SNPs in LPIN family genes were identified in milder phenotypes (mild rhabdomyolysis or myalgia). These variants were non-functional in yeast complementation assay based on respiratory activity, except the LPIN3-P24L variant.              Conclusion:                    LPIN1-related myolysis constitutes a major cause of early-onset rhabdomyolysis and occasionally in adults. Heterozygous LPIN1 mutations may cause mild muscular symptoms. No major defects of LPIN2 or LPIN3 genes were associated with muscular manifestations."
33986192,Myocardial Lipin 1 knockout in mice approximates cardiac effects of human LPIN1 mutations,"Abstract:Lipin 1 is a bifunctional protein that is a transcriptional regulator and has phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphohydrolase activity, which dephosphorylates PA to generate diacylglycerol. Human lipin 1 mutations lead to episodic rhabdomyolysis, and some affected patients exhibit cardiac abnormalities, including exercise-induced cardiac dysfunction and cardiac triglyceride accumulation. Furthermore, lipin 1 expression is deactivated in failing heart, but the effects of lipin 1 deactivation in myocardium are incompletely understood. We generated mice with cardiac-specific lipin 1 KO (cs-Lpin1-/-) to examine the intrinsic effects of lipin 1 in the myocardium. Cs-Lpin1-/- mice had normal systolic cardiac function but mild cardiac hypertrophy. Compared with littermate control mice, PA content was higher in cs-Lpin1-/- hearts, which also had an unexpected increase in diacylglycerol and triglyceride content. Cs-Lpin1-/- mice exhibited diminished cardiac cardiolipin content and impaired mitochondrial respiration rates when provided with pyruvate or succinate as metabolic substrates. After transverse aortic constriction-induced pressure overload, loss of lipin 1 did not exacerbate cardiac hypertrophy or dysfunction. However, loss of lipin 1 dampened the cardiac ionotropic response to dobutamine and exercise endurance in association with reduced protein kinase A signaling. These data suggest that loss of lipin 1 impairs cardiac functional reserve, likely due to effects on glycerolipid homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and protein kinase A signaling.

26276647,Association of LPIN1 gene variations with markers of metabolic syndrome in population from Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Abstract                        Aim:                    To investigate association of two LPIN1 gene variations with main traits of metabolic syndrome (MS) (waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and fasting glucose levels) in population from Bosnia and Herzegovina.              Methods:                    This study included 43 patients with metabolic syndrome and 43 healthy controls from General Hospital in Tešanj, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Subjects were genotyped for two LPIN1 gene variations (rs11693809: C>T and rs2716610: C>T) by real time PCR method.              Results:                    In control subjects LPIN1 polymorphism, rs2716610: C>T, was significantly associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) (p=0.008) and waist circumference (p=0.008). The second analyzed rs11693809: C>T polymorphism was associated with lower blood HbA1c levels (p=0.048) in a group of MS patients.              Conclusion:                    Results of our study suggest that rs2716610: C>T polymorphism of LPIN1 gene could have a protective effect against development of metabolic syndrome, while rs11693809: C>T might affect a glucose control in patients with MS.

32913636,Detection of compound heterozygous variants in LPIN1 does not necessarily imply pathogenicity in a patient with rhabdomyolysis,"Abstract:In a recent article by Yim et al., a 15-month-old male is described who experienced severe rhabdomyolysis with a creatine-kinase value (CKV) of 127494 U/l one day after intramuscular injection of an unidentified drug by the general practitioner. Rhabdomyolysis was not attributed to this injected drug but to compound heterozygous variants in LPIN1. The study has a number of shortcomings. Triggers of rhabdomyolysis should be unequivocally identified, a more extensive family history should be taken, and previous CKVs should be provided. Functional and biochemical tests should be carried out to confirm or exclude pathogenicity of the LPIN1 variants.

30381013,Phenotypic Modulation of Skeletal Muscle Fibers in LPIN1-Deficient Lipodystrophic ( fld) Mice,"Abstract:Lipin-1 ( Lpin1)-deficient lipodystrophic mice have scant and immature adipocytes and develop transient fatty liver early in life. Unlike normal mice, these mice cannot rely on stored triglycerides to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the β-oxidation of fatty acids during periods of fasting. To compensate, these mice store much higher amounts of glycogen in skeletal muscle and liver than wild-type mice in order to support energy needs during periods of fasting. Our studies demonstrated that there are phenotypic changes in skeletal muscle fibers that reflect an adaptation to this unique metabolic situation. The phenotype of skeletal muscle (soleus, gastrocnemius, plantaris, and extensor digitorum longus [EDL]) from Lpin1-/- was evaluated using various methods including immunohistochemistry for myosin heavy chains (Myh) 1, 2, 2a, 2b, and 2x; enzyme histochemistry for myosin ATPase, cytochrome-c oxidase (COX), and succinyl dehydrogenase (SDH); periodic acid-Schiff; and transmission electron microscopy. Fiber-type changes in the soleus muscle of Lpin1-/- mice were prominent and included decreased Myh1 expression with concomitant increases in Myh2 expression and myosin-ATPase activity; this change was associated with an increase in the presence of Myh1/2a or Myh1/2x hybrid fibers. Alterations in mitochondrial enzyme activity (COX and SDH) were apparent in the myofibers in the soleus, gastrocnemius, plantaris, and EDL muscles. Electron microscopy revealed increases in the subsarcolemmal mitochondrial mass in the muscles of Lpin1-/- mice. These data demonstrate that lipin-1 deficiency results in phenotypic fiber-specific modulation of skeletal muscle necessary for compensatory fuel utilization adaptations in lipodystrophy.

21263402,Association of PPARG and LPIN1 gene polymorphisms with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes,"Abstract                        Aim:                    Lipin 1 is a recently discovered multifunctional protein involved in the metabolism of lipids, while PPARgamma is involved in adipocyte differentiation, and regulation of lipid metabolism. Up to now, LPIN1 and PPARG gene polymorphisms have been associated with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and central obesity. In this study, we hypothesized that genetic variants within LPIN1 and PPARG genes were associated with traits of metabolic syndrome. Correlation between biochemical parameters (including but not limited to, glucose, HbA1c, insulin levels, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, serum proteins, liver enzymes) and frequency of polymorphisms in LPIN1 (rs11693809 and rs2716610) and PPARG gene (rs10865710, rs3856806 and rs1801282), was tested in this study.              Methods:                    The study included 70 patients diagnosed with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Two polymorphisms of LPIN1 gene (rs11693809 and rs2716610), and three polymorphisms of PPARG gene (rs10865710, rs385806 and rs1801282) were analyzed by real time PCR and conventional PCR-RFLP methods.              Results:                    Our analysis revealed correlation between insulin levels and rs11693809 LPIN1 polymorphism in diabetic patients. Also the results of this study showed an association of rs10865710 and rs385806 polymorphism of PPARG with HDL cholesterol and LDL plus total cholesterol levels, respectively.              Conclusion:                    These data reflect an association of analyzed PPARG and LPIN1 gene polymorphisms with values of insulin, HDL, LDL and total cholesterol witch indicates an important role of these genes in lipid metabolism and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome."
20101248,"Relation between human LPIN1, hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum stress genes in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue","Abstract                        Context:                    LPIN1 is the phosphatidic acid phosphatase that produces 1,2-diacylglycerol, and thus it is related to the synthesis of triglycerides in the adipocyte. LPIN1 has a role in lipid synthesis and nuclear receptor coactivation, both of which may be involved in lipid homeostasis and metabolism. Among others, hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are being shown to be related to the adipose dysfunction found in human obesity.              Objective:                    The aim of this study was to analyze LPIN1 gene expression in human adipose tissue in parallel with several hypoxia, angiogenic, ER stress and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-related genes in human obesity.              Design and patients:                    Gene expression was quantified in abdominal (subcutaneous and visceral) adipose tissue from 62 subjects.              Results:                    We have shown a marked association between LPIN1 and PPARalpha gene expression both in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. Similarly, a strong interdependence with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression was also described; in fact, LPIN1 and VEGF expression levels were significantly decreased with obesity to a similar extent.              Conclusion:                    These associations might suggest a possible role of LPIN1 in stress conditions that occur in chronic obesity and underlie insulin resistance."
34601076,miRNA-124-3p targeting of LPIN1 attenuates inflammation and apoptosis in aged male rats cardiopulmonary bypass model of perioperative neurocognitive disorders,"Abstract:Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is recently recommended to define the cognitive decrease during the perioperative period. However, the disease's underlying mechanisms remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that play a vital role in regulating neuroregeneration and neuronal apoptosis. In this study, miR-124-3p was significantly reduced in the PND rat model after a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedure. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124)-3p-overexpressed lentivirus was constructed and injected via the intracerebroventricular method before CPB. Morris Water Maze test (WMW) and the Open-Field test (OFT) were used to measure behavior changes, data shows decline of cognitive function of rats after CPB. PND rats expressed higher Aβ and p-Tau Protein by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses and Enzyme-Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Moreover, the results of IHC, ELISA, Western Blot analysis (WB) and Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Mediated Nick End Labeling Assay (TUNEL) showed CPB procedure induced inflammation and apoptosis in rats with PND. The data also revealed the protective function of miR-124-3p overexpression against PND in relieving inflammation, cell apoptosis, and alleviating repaired cognitive function. Moreover, miR-124-3p was predicted by directly targeting LPIN1. This study gives a novel viewpoint that miR-124-3p could improve the state of PND via modulating LPIN1, therefore providing a new strategy for preventing and treating PND in a preclinical application.

22055193,ROS-mediated p53 induction of Lpin1 regulates fatty acid oxidation in response to nutritional stress,"Abstract:The p53 protein is activated by stress signals and exhibits both protective and death-promoting functions that are considered important for its tumor suppressor function. Emerging evidence points toward an additional role for p53 in metabolism. Here, we identify Lpin1 as a p53-responsive gene that is induced in response to DNA damage and glucose deprivation. Lpin1 is essential for adipocyte development and fat metabolism, and mutation in this gene is responsible for the lypodystrophy phenotype in fld mice. We show that p53 and Lpin1 regulate fatty acid oxidation in mouse C2C12 myoblasts. p53 phosphorylation on Ser18 in response to low glucose is ROS and ATM dependent. Lpin1 expression in response to nutritional stress is controlled through the ROS-ATM-p53 pathway and is conserved in human cells. Lpin1 provides a critical link between p53 and metabolism that may be an important component in mediating the tumor suppressor function of p53."
33203880,Proto-oncogene Src links lipogenesis via lipin-1 to breast cancer malignancy,"Abstract:Increased lipogenesis has been linked to an increased cancer risk and poor prognosis; however, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here we show that phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) lipin-1, which generates diglyceride precursors necessary for the synthesis of glycerolipids, interacts with and is a direct substrate of the Src proto-oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Obesity-associated microenvironmental factors and other Src-activating growth factors, including the epidermal growth factor, activate Src and promote Src-mediated lipin-1 phosphorylation on Tyr398, Tyr413 and Tyr795 residues. The tyrosine phosphorylation of lipin-1 markedly increases its PAP activity, accelerating the synthesis of glycerophospholipids and triglyceride. Alteration of the three tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (3YF-lipin-1) disables lipin-1 from mediating Src-enhanced glycerolipid synthesis, cell proliferation and xenograft growth. Re-expression of 3YF-lipin-1 in PyVT;Lpin1-/- mice fails to promote progression and metastasis of mammary tumours. Human breast tumours exhibit increased p-Tyr-lipin-1 levels compared to the adjacent tissues. Importantly, statistical analyses show that levels of p-Tyr-lipin-1 correlate with tumour sizes, lymph node metastasis, time to recurrence and survival of the patients. These results illustrate a direct lipogenesis-promoting role of the pro-oncogenic Src, providing a mechanistic link between obesity-associated mitogenic signaling and breast cancer malignancy."
26523976,Three indel variants in chicken LPIN1 exon 6/flanking region are associated with performance and carcass traits,"Abstract:LPIN1 is a Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase. Variation in chicken LPIN1 exon 6 and its flanking regions were identified and three indel variants in 6 breeds and their associations with performance traits were studied. Seven variants were detected from 6 breeds, which contained a synonymous tri-allelic variant (c.924A/T/C) and three indels. The exon 6 variants detected from chicken breeds were conserved among bird species. The indel variation frequency presented clear differences among breeds. Two coding indels (c.1014-1018del3 and c.1125-1138del12) were multiples of three nucleotides and maintained the open reading frames of LPIN1 proteins. However, they were predicted to result in the clear change of the RNA secondary structure of chicken LPIN1 exon 6 and LPIN1 protein conformation. The association analysis showed that c.871-15-22del6 variation had a significant effect on body weight at hatch (BW0) and 2 weeks (BW2); c. 1014-1018del3 variation had a significant effect on BW4, BW6, caecum length and gizzard weight (GW) traits; c.1125-1138del12 variation had a significant effect on BW12, shank length at 4 weeks (SL4), carcass weight, lactate dehydrogenase traits (LDH), glucose (GLU) and albumin (ALB) traits. The genotype combination for c.1014-1018del3 and c.1125-1138del12 also presented significant effects on SL4, SL8, GW, leg muscle weight, ALB, GLU and LDH. The study demonstrated that chicken LPIN1 has an important effect on body, carcass and organ weight, serum LDH, GLU and ALB level."

We describe a lipin-1-deficient boy with recurrent, severe rhabdomyolytic episodes from the age of 4 years. Analysis of the LPIN1 gene that encodes lipin-1 revealed a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 9, c.1381delC (p.Leu461SerfsX47), and complete uniparental isodisomy of maternal chromosome 2. This mutation is predicted to cause complete lipin-1 deficiency. The patient had six rhabdomyolytic crises, with creatine kinase (CK) levels up to 300,000 U/L (normal, 30 to 200). Plasma CK remained elevated between crises. A treatment protocol was instituted, with early aggressive monitoring, hydration, electrolyte replacement and high caloric, high carbohydrate intake. The patient received dexamethasone during two crises, which was well-tolerated and in these episodes, peak CK values were lower than in preceding episodes. Studies of anti-inflammatory therapy may be indicated in lipin-1 deficiency.

36238640,Identification and Validation of Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Sevoflurane-Induced Hippocampal Neurotoxicity,"Abstract                        Background:                    Sevoflurane is one of the most popular inhalational anesthetics during perioperative period but presenting neurotoxicity among pediatric and aged populations. Recent experiments in vivo and in vitro have indicated that ferroptosis may contribute to the neurotoxicity of sevoflurane anesthesia. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear.              Methods:                    In current study, we explored the differential expressed genes (DEGs) in HT-22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells after sevoflurane anesthesia using RNA-seq. Differential expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) were screened and analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis. Protein-to-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). Significant modules and the hub genes were identified by using Cytoscape. The Connectivity Map (cMAP) was used for screening drug candidates targeting the identified DEFRGs. Potential TF-gene network and drug-gene pairs were established towards the hub genes. In final, we validated these results in experiments.              Results:                    A total of 37 ferroptosis-related genes (18 upregulated and 19 downregulated) after sevoflurane exposure in hippocampal neuronal cells were finally identified. These differentially expressed genes were mainly involved into the biological processes of cellular response to oxidative stress. Pathway analysis indicated that these genes were involved in ferroptosis, mTOR signaling pathway, and longevity-regulating pathway. PPI network was constructed. 10 hub genes including Prkaa2, Chac1, Arntl, Tfrc, Slc7a11, Atf4, Mgst1, Lpin1, Atf3, and Sesn2 were found. Top 10 drug candidates, gene-drug networks, and TFs targeting these genes were finally identified. These results were validated in experiments.              Conclusion:                    Our results suggested that ferroptosis-related genes play roles in sevoflurane anesthesia-related hippocampal neuron injury and offered the hub genes and potential therapeutic agents for investigating and treatment of this neurotoxicity after sevoflurane exposure. Finally, therapeutic effect of these drug candidates and function of potential ferroptosis targets should be further investigated for treatment and clarifying mechanisms of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced neuron injury in future research."
20356931,"Studies of association between LPIN1 variants and common metabolic phenotypes among 17,538 Danes","Abstract                        Objective:                    Lipin-1, encoded by LPIN1, is expressed in the major metabolically active tissues. Decreased expression of lipin-1 in adipose tissue correlates with increased insulin resistance, and tagging of the LPIN1 locus has shown that rs33997857, rs6744682, and rs6708316 associate with metabolic phenotypes, specifically body mass index (BMI) and fasting serum lipid levels, both on the individual single-nucleotide polymorphism level and with a three-marker haplotype. Our aim was to validate the reported findings in the Danish population.              Design:                    In the present study, variants were analyzed in LPIN1 using case-control studies, haplotype analyses, and quantitative trait analyses in a population of 17,538 Danes.              Methods:                    The three LPIN1 variants were genotyped in 17,538 Danes from four study populations of middle-aged people. This provided us with a statistical power >99% to replicate previous findings. Variants were analyzed individually and in haplotype combinations in studies of quantitative metabolic traits and in case-control studies.              Results:                    None of the three variants were associated with the examined quantitative traits including BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting serum lipid concentrations, or plasma glucose or serum insulin concentrations in the fasting state and following an oral glucose tolerance test. Haplotypes were tested for association with quantitative traits; however, only nominal association with blood pressure (P=0.04) and waist circumference (P=0.04) was observed. In case-control studies, no association was found for individual variants or the three-marker haplotype.              Conclusion:                    LPIN1 rs33997857, rs6744682, and rs6708316 did not associate with type 2 diabetes, obesity, or related quantitative metabolic phenotypes in the Danish population examined."
33514355,Acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis in a Chinese boy associated with a novel compound heterozygous LPIN1 variant: a case report,"Abstract                        Background:                    LPIN1-related acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis (RM), first reported in 2008, is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disease. In recent years, LPIN1 gene variants have been identified as one of the main causes of severe RM in children in Western countries. The disease is extremely rare in China, and we report a case of acute recurrent RM caused by a novel compound heterozygous LPIN1 variant.              Case presentation:                    A 15-year-old Chinese boy presented with myalgia after strenuous exercise, accompanied by transient increases in serum creatine kinase and myoglobin and persistent hyperuricaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Genetic analysis using high-throughput genomic sequencing and Sanger sequencing revealed that there was a compound heterozygous variant in the LPIN1 gene of the proband: the paternal c.2047A > G(p.I683V) was an unreported missense variant, and the maternal c.2107_2108 insAGG(p.Q703delin sQE) was an unreported in-frame variant.              Conclusions:                    In children with RM, LPIN1 variants should always be considered in the differential diagnosis. The clinical features of our case are atypical, which highlights the importance of an accurate diagnosis by genetic testing. If detected early, the condition may be controlled, and the prognosis may be improved.

32410653,A rare case of pediatric recurrent rhabdomyolysis with compound heterogenous variants in the LPIN1,"Abstract                        Background:                    Lipin-1, encoded by LPIN1 gene, serves as an enzyme and a transcriptional co-regulator to regulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory chain. Autosomal recessive mutations in LPIN1 were recognized as one of the most common causes of pediatric recurrent rhabdomyolysis in western countries. However, to date, there were only a few cases reported in Asian group. This study aims to report the first pediatric case of recurrent rhabdomyolysis with a novel LPIN1 mutation in China mainland in order to raise the awareness of both pediatricians and patients.              Case presentations:                    Here we report a Chinese pediatric case of recurrent rhabdomyolysis with compound heterozygous variants (p.Arg388* and p.Arg810Cys) in the LPIN1 gene. The c.2428C > T was a novel missense variant involved Arg-to-Cys substitution at position 810 (p.Arg810Cys), located in the highly conserved region which predicted to be damaging by multiple algorithms. The patient manifested as cola-colored urine, muscle weakness and tenderness, as well as acute kidney injury with peak blood creatine kinase level 109,570 U/l in 19-month old. In his second episode of 9 years old, the symtoms were relatively milder with peak creatine kinase level 50,948 U/l. He enjoyed quite normal life between the bouts but slightly elevation of serum creatine kinase level during the fever or long-term exercises. Prolonged weight training combined with calorie deprivation were speculated to be the triggers of his illness. Prompt symptomatic therapy including fluid therapy and nutritional support was given and the patient recovered soon.              Conclusions:                    LPIN1-related rhabdomyolysis is still quite new to physicians due to its seemly low-incidence especially in Asian countries. In the future, more active genetic test strategy and detailed prophylactic care education should be taken in patients with severe recurrent rhabdomyolysis, who are the high risk group of LPIN1 genetic defects.

34827956,Sequence Variation in the Bovine Lipin-1 Gene ( LPIN1) and Its Association with Milk Fat and Protein Contents in New Zealand Holstein-Friesian × Jersey (HF × J)-cross Dairy Cows,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is known to play a regulatory role in tissues that function in lipid metabolism. In dairy cows, the lipin-1 gene (LPIN1) is highly expressed in the mammary gland, but its function in milk production is less understood. In this study, we used PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to investigate sequence variation in three regions of bovine LPIN1 in New Zealand Holstein-Friesian × Jersey (HF × J)-cross dairy cows, including part of the 5' non-coding region, the region containing the LPIN1β-spliced exon, and the sixth coding exon that encodes the putative transcriptional activating domain of the protein. No variation was found in the LPIN1β-spliced exon, but two sequence variants containing one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were identified in the 5' non-coding region and four sequence variants containing four non-synonymous SNPs were identified in the sixth coding exon. Among the three common variants of the sixth coding exon, variant C was found to be associated with an increase in milk fat percentage (presence 4.96 ± 0.034% vs. absence 4.81 ± 0.050%; p = 0.006) and milk protein percentage (presence 4.09 ± 0.017% vs. absence 3.99 ± 0.025%; p = 0.001), but no associations (p > 0.01) were detected for milk yield. These results suggest that variation in LPIN1 affect the synthesis of fat and proteins in milk and has potential as a gene-marker to improve milk production traits.

29325813,Cardiac function and exercise adaptation in 8 children with LPIN1 mutations,"Abstract                        Introduction:                    Lipin-1 deficiency is a major cause of rhabdomyolysis that are precipitated by febrile illness. The prognosis is poor, with one-third of patients dying from cardiac arrest during a crisis episode. Apart from acute rhabdomyolysis, most patients are healthy, showing normal clinical and cardiac ultrasound parameters.              Patients and methods:                    We report cardiac and exercise examinations of 8 children carrying two LPIN1 mutations. The examinations were performed outside of a myolysis episode, but one patient presented with fever during one examination.              Results:                    All but one patient displayed normal resting cardiac function, as determined by echocardiography. One patient exhibited slight left ventricular dysfunction at rest and a lack of increased stroke volume during cycle ramp exercise. During exercise, peripheral muscle adaptation was impaired in 2 patients compared to healthy controls: they presented an abnormal increase in cardiac output relative to oxygen uptake: dQ/dVO2=8.2 and 9.5 (>2DS of controls population). One patient underwent 2 exercise tests; during one test, the patient was febrile, leading to acute rhabdomyolysis in the following hours. He exhibited changes in recovery muscle reoxygenation parameters and an increased dQ/dVO2 during exercise compared with that under normothermia (7.9 vs 6), which did not lead to acute rhabdomyolysis. The four patients assessed by cardiac 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy exhibited signs of intracardiac steatosis.              Conclusion:                    We observed abnormal haemodynamic profiles during exercise in 3/8 patients with lipin-1 deficiency, suggesting impaired muscle oxidative phosphorylation during exercise. Fever appeared to be an aggravating factor. One patient exhibited moderate cardiac dysfunction, which was possibly related to intracardiac stored lipid toxicity.

28287811,"Two Triacylglycerol Pathway Genes, CTDNEP1 and LPIN1, are Down-Regulated by hsa-miR-122-5p in Hepatocytes","Abstract                        Background:                    Expression of miR-122 is highly specific to hepatocytes of the liver. This miRNA is involved in lipid hemostasis of the tissue; however, there is no comprehensive understanding of its function in lipid hemostasis.              Materials and methods:                    Since hepatocytes are responsible for part of Triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in the body, we hypothesized that miR-122, as the most abundant miRNA in the tissue, might regulate TAG metabolism by targeting key enzymes that are involved in its production pathway. A systematic computational analysis of putative targets of miR-122 identified CTDNEP1 and LPIN1 genes in the TAG pathway. We used dual-luciferase reporter assay, quantitative RT-PCR as well as western blot to confirm the repressive effect of miR-122 on CTDNEP1 and LPIN1 in TAG pathway.              Results:                    Real time PCR on liver needle biopsies with hepatosteatosis showed that miR-122 is up-regulated in hepatosteatosis. Surprisingly, the protein and RNA level of identified targets of miR-122 are also up-regulated in clinical samples, probably as a disproportionate feedback response to the high level of miR-122.              Conclusion:                    Our findings suggest that up-regulation of miR-122 can trigger the compensatory response of LPIN1 and CTDNEP1 in hepatosteatosis."
20231281,Characterization of the human LPIN1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase isoforms,"Abstract:The human LPIN1 gene encodes the protein lipin 1, which possesses phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase; EC 3.1.3.4) activity (Han, G.-S., Wu, W.-I., and Carman, G. M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 9210-9218). In this work, we characterized human lipin 1 alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms that were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. PA phosphatase activities of the alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms were dependent on Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) ions at pH 7.5 at 37 degrees C. The activities were inhibited by concentrations of Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) above their optimums and by Ca(2+), Zn(2+), N-ethylmaleimide, propranolol, and the sphingoid bases sphingosine and sphinganine. The activities were thermally labile at temperatures above 40 degrees C. The alpha, beta, and gamma activities followed saturation kinetics with respect to the molar concentration of PA (K(m) values of 0.35, 0.24, and 0.11 mm, respectively) but followed positive cooperative (Hill number approximately 2) kinetics with respect to the surface concentration of PA (K(m) values of 4.2, 4.5, and 4.3 mol %, respectively) in Triton X-100/PA-mixed micelles. The turnover numbers (k(cat)) for the alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms were 68.8 + or - 3.5, 42.8 + or - 2.5, and 5.7 + or - 0.2 s(-1), respectively, whereas their energy of activation values were 14.2, 15.5, and 18.5 kcal/mol, respectively. The isoform activities were dependent on PA as a substrate and required at least one unsaturated fatty acyl moiety for maximum activity."
25967228,Rhabdomyolysis-Associated Mutations in Human LPIN1 Lead to Loss of Phosphatidic Acid Phosphohydrolase Activity,"Abstract:Rhabdomyolysis is an acute syndrome due to extensive injury of skeletal muscle. Recurrent rhabdomyolysis is often caused by inborn errors in intermediary metabolism, and recent work has suggested that mutations in the human gene encoding lipin 1 (LPIN1) may be a common cause of recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children. Lipin 1 dephosphorylates phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol (phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase; PAP) and acts as a transcriptional regulatory protein to control metabolic gene expression. Herein, a 3-year-old boy with severe recurrent rhabdomyolysis was determined to be a compound heterozygote for a novel c.1904T>C (p.Leu635Pro) substitution and a previously reported genomic deletion of exons 18-19 (E766-S838_del) in LPIN1. Western blotting with patient muscle biopsy lysates demonstrated a marked reduction in lipin 1 protein, while immunohistochemical staining for lipin 1 showed abnormal subcellular localization. We cloned cDNAs to express recombinant lipin 1 proteins harboring pathogenic mutations and showed that the E766-S838_del allele was not expressed at the RNA or protein level. Lipin 1 p.Leu635Pro was expressed, but the protein was less stable, was aggregated in the cytosol, and was targeted for proteosomal degradation. Another pathogenic single amino acid substitution, lipin 1 p.Arg725His, was well expressed and retained its transcriptional regulatory function. However, both p.Leu635Pro and p.Arg725His proteins were found to be deficient in PAP activity. Kinetic analyses demonstrated a loss of catalysis rather than diminished substrate binding. These data suggest that loss of lipin 1-mediated PAP activity may be involved in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis in lipin 1 deficiency."
25778939,Acute rhabdomyolysis and inflammation,"Abstract:Rhabdomyolysis results from the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers, which leads to leakage of potentially toxic cellular content into the systemic circulation. Acquired causes by direct injury to the sarcolemma are most frequent. The inherited causes are: i) metabolic with failure of energy production, including mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation defects, LPIN1 mutations, inborn errors of glycogenolysis and glycolysis, more rarely mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency, purine defects and peroxysomal α-methyl-acyl-CoA-racemase defect (AMACR), ii) structural causes with muscle dystrophies and myopathies, iii) calcium pump disorder with RYR1 gene mutations, iv) inflammatory causes with myositis. Irrespective of the cause of rhabdomyolysis, the pathology follows a common pathway, either by the direct injury to sarcolemma by increased intracellular calcium concentration (acquired causes) or by the failure of energy production (inherited causes), which leads to fiber necrosis. Rhabdomyolysis are frequently precipitated by febrile illness or exercise. These conditions are associated with two events, elevated temperature and high circulating levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. To illustrate these points in the context of energy metabolism, protein thermolability and the potential benefits of arginine therapy, we focus on a rare cause of rhabdomyolysis, aldolase A deficiency. In addition, our studies on lipin-1 (LPIN1) deficiency raise the possibility that several diseases involved in rhabdomyolysis implicate pro-inflammatory cytokines and may even represent primarily pro-inflammatory diseases. Thus, not only thermolability of mutant proteins critical for muscle function, but also pro-inflammatory cytokines per se, may lead to metabolic decompensation and rhabdomyolysis."
32779418,"A neglected cause of recurrent rhabdomyolysis, LPIN1 gene defect: a rare case from Turkey","Abstract                        Background:                    Rhabdomyolysis; can occur due to toxic, infectious, metabolic, and genetic causes. Severe rhabdomyolysis may progress to several clinical manifestations such as cardiac arrest and may pose a risk of mortality if it is not treated timely.              Case:                    In this article, we presented a 26-month-old patient who was admitted with an acute rhabdomyolysis attack and a venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was initiated on the 5th hour of hospitalization. Creatine kinase (CK) levels of the patient continued to increase (max: 943 452 IU/L) until the 5th day of treatment and hereafter began to decrease. As the common causes of rhabdomyolysis were excluded and the CK levels were the highest values reported in the literature, although, LPIN1 deficiency was the most suspected diagnosis, to facilitate the diagnostic procedures a whole-exome sequencing was performed. A homozygous [c.1696G > C p. (Asp566His)] mutation was detected on LPIN1 gene. This variant has not been described previously, however, when examined with programs such as SIFT and Mutation taster, it has been considered as pathogenic.              Conclusion:                    In the pediatric age group, especially in infants presenting with severe rhabdomyolysis, LPIN1 deficiency should also be considered; as early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce mortality.

17940119,"Genetic variants within the LPIN1 gene, encoding lipin, are influencing phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome in humans","Abstract                        Objective:                    Lipin, a novel molecular protein expressed by adipocytes, has marked effects on adipose tissue mass, insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis. Thus, we hypothesized that genetic variants within LPIN1 are associated with traits of the metabolic syndrome.              Research design and methods:                    A total of 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the LPIN1 gene region were genotyped in an age- and sex-stratified sample of the general population (Monitoring Trends and Determinants on Cardiovascular Diseases Study Augsburg; DNA and phenotypes of 1,416 Caucasians). Ten SNPs were also genotyped for replication in an independent sample of 1,030 subjects recruited throughout Germany. The metabolic syndrome was defined via the sum of its core components and, additionally, by a factor score derived from factor analysis. Permutation-based methods were used to test the association between genetic LPIN1 variants and metabolic traits for empirical significance.              Results:                    Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed three LD blocks encompassing LPIN1. We identified three associated three-marker haplotypes: one common haplotype (26.8% frequency) increases the risk for the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio 1.6 [95% CI 1.2-2.2]), while the other two, being less common (5.7 and 4.0%), are strongly associated with lower blood pressure levels (systolic blood pressure 127 +/- 18 vs. 135 +/- 20 mmHg; P = 0.0001), a lower BMI (24.6 +/- 3.6 vs. 26.9 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2); P = 3.7 x 10(-7)) and waist circumference (82 +/- 12 vs. 90 +/- 12 cm; P = 3.2 x 10(-8)), lower A1C levels (5.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.9%; P = 0.0002), as well as a lower metabolic syndrome factor score (-0.67 +/- 1.00 vs. 0.04 +/- 1.24; P = 1.4 x 10(-7)). Furthermore, the frequencies of arterial hypertension (23.7 vs. 46.4%; P = 0.00001), obesity (12.9 vs. 30.8%; P = 0.0003), diabetes (2.2 vs. 8.2%; P = 0.041), and the presence of three or more metabolic syndrome components (3.3 vs. 13.7%; P = 0.002) were significantly lower than in subjects not carrying one of these protective haplotypes. Strong associations were also observed in the replication sample using the same haplotypes but with effects in the opposite direction. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that allelic variants of the LPIN1 gene have significant effects in human metabolic traits and thus implicate lipin in the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome."
31162914,Exosomal miR-451a Functions as a Tumor Suppressor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Targeting LPIN1,"Abstract                        Background/aims:                    Emerging evidence suggests that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate hepatoma progression through the post-translational regulation of their targets. However, characteristically-expressed miRNAs and their functions in the tumor and tumor-associated angiogenesis remain poorly understood.              Methods:                    miRNA sequencing (HiSeq 2500 SE50) was performed to identify miRNA species that are involved in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. We identified miR-451a downregulation according to its expression and TCGA analysis. miR-451a was found to be mainly involved in cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle and migration both in HCC and endothelial cell lines. LPIN1 was predicted to be a target of this miRNA based on TargetScan, GSEA analysis, and the Uniprot database. We performed real time PCR and dual luciferase assays to confirm these results.              Results:                    We identified that miR-451a is significantly downregulated in serum-derived exosomes from HCC patients, as compared to expression in those from normal individuals. We further confirmed that overexpression of miR-451a functions in HCC and endothelia cells in vitro and in vivo. Exosomal miR-451a, as a tumor suppressor, was found to induce apoptosis both in HCC cell lines and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition, miR-451a suppressed HUVEC migration, tube formation, and vascular permeability. Importantly, we demonstrated that LPIN1 is a critical target of miR-451a, and promotes apoptosis in both HCC and endothelial cells.              Conclusion:                    Our study provides the novel finding that exosomal miR-451a targets LPIN1 to inhibit hepatocellular tumorigenesis by regulating tumor cell apoptosis and angiogenesis. These results have clinical implications regarding the deregulation of miRNAs in HCC.              Keywords:                    Angiogenesis; Cell apoptosis; Exosomes; HCC; miR-451a."

The aim of the study is to test the association of LPIN1 variants with Type 2 diabetes and clinical characteristics in large samples of the Chinese population.              Methods:                    In the first stage, 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms within the LPIN1 region were selected and genotyped in 3700 Chinese Han participants. In the second stage, the single nucleotide polymorphisms showing significant association or trends towards association were genotyped in an additional 3122 samples for replication. Meta-analyses and genotype-phenotype association studies were performed after combining the data from the two stages.              Results:                    In the first stage, we detected that rs16857876 was significantly associated with Type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio of 0.806 (95% CI 0.677-0.958, P = 0.015), while rs11695610 showed a trend with Type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 0.846, 95% CI 0.709-1.009, P = 0.062). In the second stage, a similar effect of rs11695610 on Type 2 diabetes was observed (odds ratio 0.849, 95% CI 0.700-1.030, P = 0.096). The meta-analyses combining the information from the two stages showed a significant effect of rs11695610 on Type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio of 0.847 (95% CI 0.744-0.965, P = 0.012). Finally, the phenotype-genotype association analyses showed that rs11695610 was associated with 2-h plasma glucose (P = 0.040) and triglyceride levels (P = 0.034).              Conclusions:                    Our data implied that common single nucleotide polymorphisms within the LPIN1 region were associated with Type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits in the Chinese population."

28986436,Normal human adipose tissue functions and differentiation in patients with biallelic LPIN1 inactivating mutations,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) that in mice is necessary for normal glycerolipid biosynthesis, controlling adipocyte metabolism, and adipogenic differentiation. Mice carrying inactivating mutations in the Lpin1 gene display the characteristic features of human familial lipodystrophy. Very little is known about the roles of lipin-1 in human adipocyte physiology. Apparently, fat distribution and weight is normal in humans carrying LPIN1 inactivating mutations, but a detailed analysis of adipose tissue appearance and functions in these patients has not been available so far. In this study, we performed a systematic histopathological, biochemical, and gene expression analysis of adipose tissue biopsies from human patients harboring LPIN1 biallelic inactivating mutations and affected by recurrent episodes of severe rhabdomyolysis. We also explored the adipogenic differentiation potential of human mesenchymal cell populations derived from lipin-1 defective patients. White adipose tissue from human LPIN1 mutant patients displayed a dramatic decrease in lipin-1 protein levels and PAP activity, with a concomitant moderate reduction of adipocyte size. Nevertheless, the adipose tissue develops without obvious histological signs of lipodystrophy and with normal qualitative composition of storage lipids. The increased expression of key adipogenic determinants such as SREBP1, PPARG, and PGC1A shows that specific compensatory phenomena can be activated in vivo in human adipocytes with deficiency of functional lipin-1.

32912335,SIRT3 deficiency exacerbates fatty liver by attenuating the HIF1α-LIPIN 1 pathway and increasing CD36 through Nrf2,"Abstract                        Background:                    Deficiency of mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that maintains redox status and lipid homeostasis, contributes to hepatic steatosis. In this study, we investigated additional mechanisms that might play a role in aggravating hepatic steatosis in Sirt3-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD).              Methods:                    Studies were conducted in wild-type (WT) and Sirt3-/- mice fed a standard diet or a HFD and in SIRT3-knockdown human Huh-7 hepatoma cells.              Results:                    Sirt3-/- mice fed a HFD presented exacerbated hepatic steatosis that was accompanied by decreased expression and DNA-binding activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and of several of its target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, compared to WT mice fed the HFD. Interestingly, Sirt3 deficiency in liver and its knockdown in Huh-7 cells resulted in upregulation of the nuclear levels of LIPIN1, a PPARα co-activator, and of the protein that controls its levels and localization, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). These changes were prevented by lipid exposure through a mechanism that might involve a decrease in succinate levels. Finally, Sirt3-/- mice fed the HFD showed increased levels of some proteins involved in lipid uptake, such as CD36 and the VLDL receptor. The upregulation in CD36 was confirmed in Huh-7 cells treated with a SIRT3 inhibitor or transfected with SIRT3 siRNA and incubated with palmitate, an effect that was prevented by the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385.              Conclusion:                    These findings demonstrate new mechanisms by which Sirt3 deficiency contributes to hepatic steatosis. Video abstract.

18559480,Phosphatidic acid mediates demyelination in Lpin1 mutant mice,"Abstract:Lipids play crucial roles in many aspects of glial cell biology, affecting processes ranging from myelin membrane biosynthesis to axo-glial interactions. In order to study the role of lipid metabolism in myelinating glial cells, we specifically deleted in Schwann cells the Lpin1 gene, which encodes the Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1) enzyme necessary for normal triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The affected animals developed pronounced peripheral neuropathy characterized by myelin degradation, Schwann cell dedifferentiation and proliferation, and a reduction in nerve conduction velocity. The observed demyelination is mediated by endoneurial accumulation of the substrate of the PAP1 enzyme, phosphatidic acid (PA). In addition, we show that PA is a potent activator of the MEK-Erk pathway in Schwann cells, and that this activation is required for PA-induced demyelination. Our results therefore reveal a surprising role for PA in Schwann cell fate determination and provide evidence of a direct link between diseases affecting lipid metabolism and abnormal Schwann cell function."
12111372,Identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human LPIN1 gene,"Abstract:Because mutations in the murine analog of human LPIN1 cause lipodystrophy in mice, LPIN1 is a candidate gene for human lipodystrophy syndromes. To identify possible disease mutations and/or common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we developed primer pairs to amplify the 21 exons of LPIN1. We used these primer pairs to sequence LPIN1 in lipodystrophy patients who had no mutations in known lipodystrophy genes, and also in normal control subjects. We found no rare LPIN1 coding sequence variants that were exclusive to patients with lipodystrophy. However, we found four silent SNPs, namely, +17C>T in exon 3, 935C>T in exon 5, and 1040G>A and 1079G>C in exon 6, and one nonsynonymous SNP, namely, 2211C>T (P616S) in exon 15. The findings suggest that LPIN1mutations are not commonly seen in patients with lipodystrophy who had no mutations in known disease genes. However, the identification of amplification primers and SNPs provides tools to further investigate LPIN1for association with other phenotypes."
34729306,"3D disorganization and rearrangement of genome provide insights into pathogenesis of NAFLD by integrated Hi-C, Nanopore, and RNA sequencing","Abstract:The three-dimensional (3D) conformation of chromatin is integral to the precise regulation of gene expression. The 3D genome and genomic variations in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are largely unknown, despite their key roles in cellular function and physiological processes. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), Nanopore sequencing, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) assays were performed on the liver of normal and NAFLD mice. A high-resolution 3D chromatin interaction map was generated to examine different 3D genome hierarchies including A/B compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and chromatin loops by Hi-C, and whole genome sequencing identifying structural variations (SVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) by Nanopore sequencing. We identified variations in thousands of regions across the genome with respect to 3D chromatin organization and genomic rearrangements, between normal and NAFLD mice, and revealed gene dysregulation frequently accompanied by these variations. Candidate target genes were identified in NAFLD, impacted by genetic rearrangements and spatial organization disruption. Our data provide a high-resolution 3D genome interaction resource for NAFLD investigations, revealed the relationship among genetic rearrangements, spatial organization disruption, and gene regulation, and identified candidate genes associated with these variations implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The newly findings offer insights into novel mechanisms of NAFLD pathogenesis and can provide a new conceptual framework for NAFLD therapy.

31723421,Case Report: The first probable Hong Kong Chinese case of LPIN1-related acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis in a boy with two novel variants,"Abstract:Recurrent rhabdomyolysis is frequently ascribed to fatty acid ß-oxidation defects, mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders and glycogen storage-related diseases. In recent years, autosomal recessive LPIN1 mutations have been identified as a prevailing cause of severe rhabdomyolysis in children in Western countries. We report the first probable Hong Kong Chinese case of recurrent severe rhabdomyolysis in early childhood caused by LPIN1 variants. Compound heterozygous novel variants NM_145693.2(LPIN1):c.[1949_1967dupGTGTCACCACGCAGTACCA]; [2410G>C] (p.[Gly657Cysfs*12];[Asp804His]) were detected. The former variant was classified as likely pathogenic while the latter variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) based on the guideline published by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) in 2015. Although the genetic findings were inconclusive, the patient's presentation was compatible with LPIN1-related acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis, and the patient was treated as such. The early recognition, timely diagnosis and management of this condition are important to avoid fatal consequences. To our knowledge, there has been no previous report in the English-language literature of a child with Chinese ethnicity and LPIN1-related acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis (MIM #268200). Functional characterization of the novel variants detected in this study are warranted in future studies.

18817903,Mutations in LPIN1 cause recurrent acute myoglobinuria in childhood,"Abstract:Recurrent episodes of life-threatening myoglobinuria in childhood are caused by inborn errors of glycogenolysis, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Nonetheless, approximately half of the patients do not suffer from a defect in any of these pathways. Using homozygosity mapping, we identified six deleterious mutations in the LPIN1 gene in patients who presented at 2-7 years of age with recurrent, massive rhabdomyolysis. The LPIN1 gene encodes the muscle-specific phosphatidic acid phosphatase, a key enzyme in triglyceride and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. Of six individuals who developed statin-induced myopathy, one was a carrier for Glu769Gly, a pathogenic mutation in the LPIN1 gene. Analysis of phospholipid content disclosed accumulation of phosphatidic acid and lysophospholipids in muscle tissue of the more severe genotype. Mutations in the LPIN1 gene cause recurrent rhabdomyolysis in childhood, and a carrier state may predispose for statin-induced myopathy."
17950103,"Human subcutaneous adipose tissue LPIN1 expression in obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and human immunodeficiency virus--associated lipodystrophy syndrome","Abstract:The aim of this study was to analyze LPIN1 adipose tissue gene expression levels in 3 clinical insulin-resistant conditions-obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lipodystrophy-and its relationship with adipogenic and inflammatory markers. Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were obtained from 2 cohorts: 98 subjects with different degrees of adiposity and with or without the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and 37 HIV-infected patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure gene expression of LPIN1 and adipogenic (PPARgamma, SREBP1c) and inflammatory markers (IL6, TNFalpha, TNFR1, and TNFR2). LPIN1 messenger RNA expression levels were significantly lower in the obese group (P = .002), were similar in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and control subjects (P = .211), and were significantly higher in HIV-infected patients (P < .001). LPIN1 messenger RNA levels positively correlated with insulin sensitivity in all subjects. Moreover, an inverse correlation with proinflammatory cytokines was observed."
23796115,A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the LPIN1 gene and association analysis with performance traits in chicken,"Abstract:1. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), c.*77C>G, was found in the 3' UTR of the chicken LPIN1 gene by DNA sequencing. In total, 860 chickens were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in a F2 resource population obtained by crossing F0 Gushi chickens and Anka broilers, and the associations of this polymorphism with chicken growth, carcass, muscle fibre traits and serum biochemistry parameters were analysed. 2. Significant associations were found between the polymorphism and breast muscle fibre diameter (FDB). Comparison of the different genotypes of c.*77C>G in the F2 resource population showed that the GG genotype had significantly higher values than that of CG genotype in FDB. c.*77C>G was predicted to cause changes to multiple microRNA (miRNA) binding sites. But the total mRNA level of chicken LPIN1, LPIN1-;α and LPIN1-β in liver and muscle tissues did not show significant difference among GG, CG and CC genotypes, respectively. 3. The results suggested that chicken LPIN1 has a potential effect on muscle fibre development, but no effect on other studied traits."
29457836,DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein suppresses lipogenesis and ameliorates hepatic steatosis and acute-on-chronic liver injury in alcoholic liver disease,"Abstract:Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by lipid accumulation and liver injury. However, how chronic alcohol consumption causes hepatic lipid accumulation remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a causal role in alcoholic steatosis, inflammation, and liver injury. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to hyperactivation of mTORC1, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream kinase S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in hepatocytes. Aberrant activation of mTORC1 was likely attributed to the defects of the DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the liver of chronic-plus-binge ethanol-fed mice and in the liver of patients with ALD. Conversely, adenoviral overexpression of hepatic DEPTOR suppressed mTORC1 signaling and ameliorated alcoholic hepatosteatosis, inflammation, and acute-on-chronic liver injury. Mechanistically, the lipid-lowering effect of hepatic DEPTOR was attributable to decreased proteolytic processing, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). DEPTOR-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 also attenuated alcohol-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of the lipogenic regulator lipin 1 and prevented alcohol-mediated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Pharmacological intervention with rapamycin alleviated the ability of alcohol to up-regulate lipogenesis, to down-regulate fatty acid oxidation, and to induce steatogenic phenotypes. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to activation of SREBP-1 and lipin 1 through S6K1-dependent and independent mechanisms. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1 disrupted DEPTOR function, enhanced mTORC1 activity, and exacerbated alcoholic fatty liver, inflammation, and liver injury in mice.              Conclusion:                    The dysregulation of SIRT1-DEPTOR-mTORC1 signaling is a critical determinant of ALD pathology; targeting SIRT1 and DEPTOR and selectively inhibiting mTORC1-S6K1 signaling may have therapeutic potential for treating ALD in humans.

18492828,"ACSL1, AGPAT6, FABP3, LPIN1, and SLC27A6 are the most abundant isoforms in bovine mammary tissue and their expression is affected by stage of lactation","Abstract:The lactating bovine mammary gland is a formidable triacylglycerol-synthesizing machine and, as such, represents an ideal model for studying putative functions of distinct isoforms of solute carrier family 27 transporters [(SLC27A) 1, 2, 3, 5, 6], long chain acyl-CoA synthetases [(ACSL) 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], fatty acid binding proteins [(FABP) 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferases [(AGPAT) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and lipins [(LPIN) 1, 2, 3]. The relative percentage of mRNA abundance and fold-changes in the expression of isoforms in mammary tissue from 6 cows each at -15, 15, 60, and 240 d relative to parturition were analyzed using quantitative PCR. Transcripts of FABP isoforms were most abundant, accounting for 78% of the 28 genes measured, and SLC27A isoforms were least abundant (< 0.5% of genes measured). mRNA of AGPAT, ACSL, and LPIN accounted for approximately 12, 7, or approximately 2%, respectively, of all genes measured. The mRNA abundance at 60 d postpartum for FABP3, ACSL1, AGPAT6, and LPIN1 was 80-, 7-, 15-, and 20-fold greater relative to -15 d. Transcripts of these isoforms constituted the most abundant within each specific gene family. SLC27A2, SLC27A5, and SLC27A6 had peak expression at 240, 240, or 15 d relative to parturition, respectively. Results suggest that SLC27A6, ACSL1, FABP3, AGPAT6, and LPIN1 coordinately regulate the channeling of fatty acids toward copious milk fat synthesis in bovine mammary."
29323242,Adipose-specific lipin1 overexpression in mice protects against alcohol-induced liver injury,"Abstract:Excessive fatty acid release from the white adipose tissue (WAT) contributes to the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Lipin1 (LPIN1), as a co-regulator of DNA-bound transcription factors and a phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that dephosphorylates PA to form diacylglycerol (DAG), is dramatically reduced by alcohol in the WAT. This study aimed at determining the role of adipose LPIN1 in alcohol-induced lipodystrophy and the development of ALD. Transgenic mice overexpressing LPIN1 in adipose tissue (LPIN1-Tg) and wild type (WT) mice were fed a Lieber-DeCarli alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin control liquid diet for 8 weeks. Alcohol feeding to WT mice resulted in significant liver damage, which was significantly alleviated in the LPIN1-Tg mice. Alcohol feeding significantly reduced epididymal WAT (EWAT) mass, inhibited lipogenesis, and increased lipolysis in WT mice, which were attenuated in the LPIN1-Tg mice. LPIN1 overexpression also partially reversed alcohol-reduced plasma leptin levels. In WT mice, alcohol feeding induced hepatic lipid accumulation and down-regulation of beta-oxidation genes, which were dramatically alleviated in the LPIN1-Tg mice. LPIN1 overexpression also significantly attenuated alcohol-induced hepatic ER stress. These results suggest that overexpression of LPIN1 in adipose tissue restores WAT lipid storage function and secretive function to alleviate alcohol-induced liver injury."
35942668,Recent advances in our understanding of genetic rhabdomyolysis,"Abstract                        Purpose of review:                    This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of rhabdomyolysis.              Recent findings:                    Rhabdomyolysis is the acute breakdown of myofibres resulting in systemic changes that can be life-threatening. Environmental triggers, including trauma, exercise, toxins and infections, and/or gene defects can precipitate rhabdomyolysis. A schema (aptly titled RHABDO) has been suggested for evaluating whether a patient with rhabdomyolysis is likely to harbour an underlying genetic defect. It is becoming increasingly recognized that defects in muscular dystrophy and myopathy genes can trigger rhabdomyolysis, even as the sole or presenting feature. Variants in genes not previously associated with human disease have been identified recently as causative of rhabdomyolysis, MLIP , MYH1 and OBSCN . Our understanding of the pathomechanisms contributing to rhabdomyolysis have also improved with an increased awareness of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in LPIN1 , FDX2 , ISCU and TANGO2 -mediated disease.              Summary:                    An accurate genetic diagnosis is important for optimal clinical management of the patient, avoiding associated triggers and genetic counselling and cascade screening. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the genetics contributing to rhabdomyolysis, many patients remain without an accurate genetic diagnosis, suggesting there are many more causative genes, variants and disease mechanisms to uncover."
25678092,Lipin family proteins--key regulators in lipid metabolism,"Abstract                        Background:                    Proteins in the lipin family play a key role in lipid synthesis due to their phosphatidate phosphatase activity, and they also act as transcriptional coactivators to regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The lipin family includes three members, lipin1, lipin2, and lipin3, which exhibit tissue-specific expression, indicating that they may have distinct roles in mediating disease. To date, most studies have focused on lipin1, whereas the roles of lipin2 and lipin3 are less understood.              Summary:                    This review introduces the structural characteristics, physiological functions, relationship to lipid metabolism, and patterns of expression of the lipin family proteins, highlighting their roles in lipid metabolic homeostasis."
23426382,"The role of genetic variants in CYP2C8, LPIN1, PPARGC1A and PPARγ on the trough steady-state plasma concentrations of rosiglitazone and on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c in type 2 diabetes","Abstract                        Objective:                    The aim of this study was to examine the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2C8, LPIN1, PPARGC1A and PPARγ on rosiglitazone's (i) trough steady-state plasma concentration (C(ss,min)), (ii) on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and (iii) the risk of developing adverse events, mainly oedema, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).              Methods:                    The data used in this study were obtained from the South Danish Diabetes Study including 371 T2D patients with a focus on the 187 patients who were treated with rosiglitazone. The study was a placebo-controlled, partly blinded and multicentre clinical trial. The C(ss,min) of rosiglitazone and HbA1c was determined and the genotype of the patients was identified.              Results:                    The mean C(ss,min) of rosiglitazone was 21.3 ng/ml (95% confidence interval 18.8; 24.2 ng/ml), with observations ranging from 1 to 296 ng/ml. Carriers of CYP2C8*3 (n=32) (rs10509681 and rs11572080) had a statistically significantly lower mean C(ss,min) than wild types (n=106), and they also had a statistically significantly lower mean absolute difference in HbA1c during rosiglitazone treatment. Finally, the carriers of CYP2C8*3 had a lower odds ratio of developing oedema.              Conclusion:                    We showed that CYP2C8*3 was associated with lower plasma levels of rosiglitazone and hence a reduced therapeutic response but also a lower risk of developing oedema during treatment with rosiglitazone. Individualized treatment with rosiglitazone on the basis of the CYP2C8 genotype may therefore be possible."
25300978,Inborn errors of cytoplasmic triglyceride metabolism,"Abstract:Triglyceride (TG) synthesis, storage, and degradation together constitute cytoplasmic TG metabolism (CTGM). CTGM is mostly studied in adipocytes, where starting from glycerol-3-phosphate and fatty acyl (FA)-coenzyme A (CoA), TGs are synthesized then stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. TG hydrolysis proceeds sequentially, producing FAs and glycerol. Several reactions of CTGM can be catalyzed by more than one enzyme, creating great potential for complex tissue-specific physiology. In adipose tissue, CTGM provides FA as a systemic energy source during fasting and is related to obesity. Inborn errors and mouse models have demonstrated the importance of CTGM for non-adipose tissues, including skeletal muscle, myocardium and liver, because steatosis and dysfunction can occur. We discuss known inborn errors of CTGM, including deficiencies of: AGPAT2 (a form of generalized lipodystrophy), LPIN1 (childhood rhabdomyolysis), LPIN2 (an inflammatory condition, Majeed syndrome, described elsewhere in this issue), DGAT1 (protein loosing enteropathy), perilipin 1 (partial lipodystrophy), CGI-58 (gene ABHD5, neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) with ichthyosis and ""Jordan's anomaly"" of vacuolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, gene PNPLA2, NLSD with myopathy, cardiomyopathy and Jordan's anomaly), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL, gene LIPE, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance). Two inborn errors of glycerol metabolism are known: glycerol kinase (GK, causing pseudohypertriglyceridemia) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1, childhood hepatic steatosis). Mouse models often resemble human phenotypes but may diverge markedly. Inborn errors have been described for less than one-third of CTGM enzymes, and new phenotypes may yet be identified."
34750429,Adipose MDM2 regulates systemic insulin sensitivity,"Abstract:The intimate association between obesity and type II diabetes urges for a deeper understanding of adipocyte function. We and others have previously delineated a role for the tumor suppressor p53 in adipocyte biology. Here, we show that mice haploinsufficient for MDM2, a key regulator of p53, in their adipose stores suffer from overt obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. These mice had decreased levels of circulating palmitoleic acid [non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) 16:1] concomitant with impaired visceral adipose tissue expression of Scd1 and Ffar4. A similar decrease in Scd and Ffar4 expression was found in in vitro differentiated adipocytes with perturbed MDM2 expression. Lowered MDM2 levels led to nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional cofactors, MORC2 and LIPIN1, and thereby possibly hampered adipocyte function by antagonizing LIPIN1-mediated PPARγ coactivation. Collectively, these data argue for a hitherto unknown interplay between MDM2 and MORC2/LIPIN1 involved in balancing adipocyte function."
21804322,[Lipin 1 in lipid metabolism],"Abstract:The gene encoding lipin 1 was identified with a positional cloning approach that localized the causative mutation in fatty liver dystrophic (fld) mice, a mouse model of lipodystrophy. The fld mouse lacks normal adipose tissue in the body, and displays metabolic dysregulation such as obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertriglyceridemia. Lipin 1 is abundantly expressed in key metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. In the cytosol, lipin 1 acts as an Mg²⁺-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase type-1 (PAP1), catalyzing a key step in the synthesis of glycerolipids. In the nucleus, lipin 1 acts as a transcriptional coactivator through its direct interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and PPARα. Through two distinct functions in the nucleus and cytosol, lipin 1 modulates lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Here we will discuss recent developments in our understanding of the role of lipin 1 in lipid metabolism."
20943485,[Research and development of Lipin family],"Abstract:Lipin family including at least three members Lipin 1, Lipin 2, and Lipin 3 is a critical regulatory enzyme identified recently, which plays dual roles in lipid metabolisms. Lipin family has physiological effects not only on regulating lipid metabolism, but also on maintaining normal peripheral nervous functions, liver lipoprotein secretion, cell morphous, reproductive functions, and energy homeostasis. Since mutations in Lipin gene express may be associated with AIDS, insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and the other diseases of metabolic syndrome, Lipin may be a new useful target in treatment of above-mentioned clinical-related diseases. In this article, we focused on discovery, construction features, expression, regulatory mechanism, and biological functions of Lipin, as well as its correlation research with clinical-related diseases."
21470873,Dual function lipin proteins and glycerolipid metabolism,"Abstract:Lipin family proteins are emerging as crucial regulators of lipid metabolism. In triglyceride synthesis, lipins act as lipid phosphatase enzymes at the endoplasmic reticular membrane, catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol, which is the penultimate step in this process. However, lipin proteins are not integral membrane proteins, and can rapidly translocate within the cell. In fact, emerging evidence suggests that lipins also play crucial roles in the nucleus as transcriptional regulatory proteins. Thus, lipins are poised to regulate cellular lipid metabolism at multiple regulatory nodal points. This review summarizes the history of lipin proteins, and discusses the current state of our understanding of lipin biology."
33003344,Regulation of Signaling and Metabolism by Lipin-mediated Phosphatidic Acid Phosphohydrolase Activity,"Abstract:Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a glycerophospholipid intermediate in the triglyceride synthesis pathway that has incredibly important structural functions as a component of cell membranes and dynamic effects on intracellular and intercellular signaling pathways. Although there are many pathways to synthesize and degrade PA, a family of PA phosphohydrolases (lipin family proteins) that generate diacylglycerol constitute the primary pathway for PA incorporation into triglycerides. Previously, it was believed that the pool of PA used to synthesize triglyceride was distinct, compartmentalized, and did not widely intersect with signaling pathways. However, we now know that modulating the activity of lipin 1 has profound effects on signaling in a variety of cell types. Indeed, in most tissues except adipose tissue, lipin-mediated PA phosphohydrolase activity is far from limiting for normal rates of triglyceride synthesis, but rather impacts critical signaling cascades that control cellular homeostasis. In this review, we will discuss how lipin-mediated control of PA concentrations regulates metabolism and signaling in mammalian organisms.              Keywords:                    diacylglycerol; lipin; phosphatidic acid; signaling."
33456573,Lipin 1 deficiency causes adult-onset myasthenia with motor neuron dysfunction in humans and neuromuscular junction defects in zebrafish,"Abstract:Lipin 1 is an intracellular protein acting as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase enzyme controlling lipid metabolism. Human recessive mutations in LPIN1 cause recurrent, early-onset myoglobinuria, a condition normally associated with muscle pain and weakness. Whether and how lipin 1 deficiency in humans leads to peripheral neuropathy is yet unclear. Herein, two novel compound heterozygous mutations in LPIN1 with neurological disorders, but no myoglobinuria were identified in an adult-onset syndromic myasthenia family. The present study sought to explore the pathogenic mechanism of LPIN1 in muscular and neural development. Methods: The clinical diagnosis of the proband was compared to the known 48 cases of LPIN1 recessive homozygous mutations. Whole-exome sequencing was carried out on the syndromic myasthenia family to identify the causative gene. The pathogenesis of lipin 1 deficiency during somitogenesis and neurogenesis was investigated using the zebrafish model. Whole-mount in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, birefringence analysis, touch-evoke escape response and locomotion assays were performed to observe in vivo the changes in muscles and neurons. The conservatism of the molecular pathways regulated by lipin 1 was evaluated in human primary glioblastoma and mouse myoblast cells by siRNA knockdown, drug treatment, qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Results: The patient exhibited adult-onset myasthenia accompanied by muscle fiber atrophy and nerve demyelination without myoglobinuria. Two novel heterozygous mutations, c.2047A>C (p.I683L) and c.2201G>A (p.R734Q) in LPIN1, were identified in the family and predicted to alter the tertiary structure of LPIN1 protein. Lipin 1 deficiency in zebrafish embryos generated by lpin1 morpholino knockdown or human LPIN1 mutant mRNA injections reproduced the myotomes defects, a reduction both in primary motor neurons and secondary motor neurons projections, morphological changes of post-synaptic clusters of acetylcholine receptors, and myelination defects, which led to reduced touch-evoked response and abnormalities of swimming behaviors. Loss of lipin 1 function in zebrafish and mammalian cells also exhibited altered expression levels of muscle and neuron markers, as well as abnormally enhanced Notch signaling, which was partially rescued by the specific Notch pathway inhibitor DAPT. Conclusions: These findings pointed out that the compound heterozygous mutations in human LPIN1 caused adult-onset syndromic myasthenia with peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, zebrafish could be used to model the neuromuscular phenotypes due to the lipin 1 deficiency, where a novel pathological role of over-activated Notch signaling was discovered and further confirmed in mammalian cell lines.              Keywords:                    LPIN1; Notch signaling; neuromuscular development; syndromic myasthenia; zebrafish morphants."
25195639,Towards a mechanistic understanding of lipodystrophy and seipin functions,"Abstract:CGL (Congenital generalized lipodystrophy) is a genetic disorder characterized by near complete loss of adipose tissue along with increased ectopic fat storage in other organs including liver and muscle. Of the four CGL types, BSCL2 (Berardinelli-Seip Congenital lipodystrophy type 2), resulting from mutations in the BSCL2/seipin gene, exhibits the most severe lipodystrophic phenotype with loss of both metabolic and mechanical adipose depots. The majority of Seipin mutations cause C-terminal truncations, along with a handful of point mutations. Seipin localizes to the ER and is composed of a conserved region including a luminal loop and two transmembrane domains, plus cytosolic N- and C-termini. Animal models deficient in seipin recapitulate the human lipodystrophic phenotype. Cells isolated from seipin knockout mouse models also exhibit impaired adipogenesis. Mechanistically, seipin appears to function as a scaffolding protein to bring together interacting partners essential for lipid metabolism and LD (lipid droplet) formation during adipocyte development. Moreover, cell line and genetic studies indicate that seipin functions in a cell-autonomous manner. Here we will provide a brief overview of the genetic association of the CGLs, and focus on the current understanding of differential contributions of distinct seipin domains to lipid storage and adipogenesis. We will also discuss the roles of seipin-interacting partners, including lipin 1 and 14-3-3β, in mediating seipin-dependent regulation of cellular pathways such as actin cytoskeletal remodelling."
25595739,The role of lipin-1 in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver,"Abstract                        Aims:                    The aim of this review was to focus on the knowledge of the role of lipin-1 in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver.              Methods:                    Systematic review of animal clinical and cell level studies related to the function of lipin-1 on alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic liver cirrhosis disease.              Result:                    Ethanol could increase the expression of lipin-1 through the AMPK-SREBP-1 signaling and dramatically increase the ratio of Lpin1β to Lpin1α by SIRT1-SFRS10-Lpin1β/α axis in the liver. Moreover, research has shown that over-expression of lipin-1 could also remarkably suppress very low density lipoprotein-triacylglyceride secretion. Last, lipin-1 has potent anti-inflammatory property.              Conclusion:                    In conclusion, lipin-1 has dual functions in lipid metabolism. In the cytoplasm, lipin-1β functions as a Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) enzyme in triglyceride synthesis pathways. In the nucleus, lipin-1α acts as a transcriptional co-regulator to regulate the capacity of the liver for fatty acid oxidation and activity of the lipogenic enzyme. In hepatocytes of alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), ethanol increases the expression of lipin-1 through the AMPK-SREBP-1 signaling and the Lpin1β/α ratio by SIRT1-SFRS10- Lpin1β/α axis. Of course, in addition to that, ethanol could also produce the PAP activity and interrupt the nucleus function of lipin-1. Furthermore, over-expression of lipin-1 could remarkably suppress very low-density lipoprotein-triacylglyceride (VLDL-TAG) secretion. In the end, endogenous lipin-1 has potent anti-inflammatory property. Increased synthesis of TAG, decreased fatty acid oxidation, impaired VLDL-TAG secretion and activated inflammatory factors act together to exacerbate the development of AFLD."
34467247,Compromised mitochondrial quality control triggers lipin1-related rhabdomyolysis,"Abstract              LPIN1 mutations are responsible for inherited recurrent rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening condition with no efficient therapeutic intervention. Here, we conduct a bedside-to-bench-and-back investigation to study the pathophysiology of lipin1 deficiency. We find that lipin1-deficient myoblasts exhibit a reduction in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate close to autophagosomes and late endosomes that prevents the recruitment of the GTPase Armus, locks Rab7 in the active state, inhibits vesicle clearance by fusion with lysosomes, and alters their positioning and function. Oxidized mitochondrial DNA accumulates in late endosomes, where it activates Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and triggers inflammatory signaling and caspase-dependent myolysis. Hydroxychloroquine blocks TLR9 activation by mitochondrial DNA in vitro and may attenuate flares of rhabdomyolysis in 6 patients treated. We suggest a critical role for defective clearance of oxidized mitochondrial DNA that activates TLR9-restricted inflammation in lipin1-related rhabdomyolysis. Interventions blocking TLR9 activation or inflammation can improve patient care in vivo.              Trial registration:                    ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04007562.

19369868,The lipin family: mutations and metabolism,"Abstract                        Purpose of review:                    The family of three lipin proteins act as phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes required for glycerolipid biosynthesis, and also as transcriptional coactivators that regulate expression of lipid metabolism genes. The genes for lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3 are expressed in key metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver, but the physiological functions of each member of the family have not been fully elucidated. Here we examine the most recent studies that provide information about the roles of lipin proteins in metabolism and human disease.              Recent findings:                    Recent studies have identified mutations that cause lipin-1 or lipin-2 deficiency in humans, leading to acute myoglobinuria in childhood or the inflammatory disorder Majeed syndrome, respectively. The effects of lipin-1 deficiency appear to include both the loss of glycerolipid building blocks and the accumulation of lipid intermediates that disrupt cellular function. Several studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in the LPIN1 and LPIN2 genes are associated with metabolic disease traits, including insulin sensitivity, diabetes, blood pressure and response to thiazolidinedione drugs. Furthermore, lipin-1 expression levels in adipose tissue and/or liver are positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Studies of lipin-1 in adipocytes have shed some light on its relationship with insulin sensitivity.              Summary:                    Lipin-1 and lipin-2 are required for normal lipid homeostasis and have unique physiological roles. Future studies, for example using engineered mouse models, will be required to fully elucidate their specific roles in normal physiology and disease."
19770177,PPAR control: it's SIRTainly as easy as PGC,"Abstract:This review describes recent advances in our knowledge of the regulatory interactions influencing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-regulated genes. We address recent advances highlighting the role of PPARgamma (PPARG) coactivator-1 (PGC-1) and lipin-1 in co-ordinating the expression of genes controlling nutrient handling. We evaluate the possibility that SIRT1 lies at the heart of a regulatory loop involving PPARalpha, PGC-1alpha (PPARA, PPARGC1A as given in the HUGO Database), and lipin-1 (LPIN1 as listed in the HUGO Database) that ultimately controls the metabolic response to varying nutrient and physiological signals via a common mechanism mediated by post-translation modifications (deacetylation) of both PPARalpha and PGC-1s. Finally, we comment on the potential of pharmaceutical manipulation of these targets as well as the possible problems associated with this strategy."
25998609,Dystrophinopathy mimicking metabolic myopathies,"Abstract:Recurrent rhabdomyolysis warrants comprehensive evaluations to search for underlying muscle diseases, including metabolic myopathies, LPIN1-myopathy, RYR1-myopathy, and less commonly muscular dystrophies. The absence of weakness and the normal or minimally elevated creatine kinase levels between attacks are typical of metabolic myopathies, LPIN1-myopathy, and RYR1-myopathy, while the presence of weakness and the highly elevated creatine kinase levels between attacks point toward muscular dystrophies. Here we report a 32-year-old man with a one-year history of recurrent rhabdomyolysis, who had normal strength, slightly elevated baseline creatine kinase level, and normal muscle histopathology. All workups for metabolic myopathies, LPIN1-myopathy and RYR1-myopathy were unrevealing. Next generation sequencing of muscular dystrophy-related genes revealed a hemizygous deletion of exons 17-34 of the dystrophin-encoding gene. Immunohistochemical study revealed absent staining for the rod domain of dystrophin. Dystrophinopathy should be considered in patients with recurrent rhabdomyolysis despite the absence of fixed weakness or highly elevated resting creatine kinase level.

24274878,Host genetic variants in obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Abstract:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex disease. The considerable variability in the natural history of the disease suggests an important role for genetic variants in the disease development and progression. There is evidence based on genome-wide association studies and/or candidate gene studies that genetic polymorphisms underlying insulin signaling, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, fibrogenesis, and inflammation can predispose individuals to NAFLD. This review highlights some of the genetic variants in NAFLD.              Keywords:                    GWAS; Polymorphism; SNP; Steatosis."
30952780,A Healthy Toddler With Fever and Lethargy,"Abstract:A 21-month-old previously healthy girl presented to the emergency department initially with fever, rhinorrhea, and poor oral intake. She was subsequently discharged from the hospital on amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media but presented hours later on the same day with continued poor oral intake, decreased urine output, and lethargy. The patient was afebrile on examination without a focal source of infection or evidence of meningismus, but she was lethargic and minimally responsive to pain and had reduced strength in the upper and lower extremities. Initial laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis with a neutrophil predominance and bandemia, hyponatremia, mild hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, elevated transaminases, a mild metabolic acidosis, glucosuria, ketonuria, and hematuria. Follow-up tests, based on the history and results of the initial tests, were sent and led to a surprising diagnosis."
28411173,Lipin proteins and glycerolipid metabolism: Roles at the ER membrane and beyond,"Abstract:The regulation of glycerolipid biosynthesis is critical for homeostasis of cellular lipid stores and membranes. Here we review the role of lipin phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzymes in glycerolipid synthesis. Lipin proteins are unique among glycerolipid biosynthetic enzymes in their ability to transit among cellular membranes, rather than remain membrane tethered. We focus on the mechanisms that underlie lipin protein interactions with membranes and the versatile roles of lipins in several organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, endolysosomes, lipid droplets, and nucleus. We also review the corresponding physiological roles of lipins, which have been uncovered by the study of genetic lipin deficiencies. We propose that the growing body of knowledge concerning the biochemical and cellular activities of lipin proteins will be valuable for understanding the physiological functions of lipin proteins in health and disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Lipid Therapy: Drugs Targeting Biomembranes edited by Pablo V. Escribá.

19948145,An emerging role of mTOR in lipid biosynthesis,"Abstract:Lipid biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The lipids produced by cells (glycerolipids, fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and sphingolipids) are used as an energy source/reserve, as building blocks for membrane biosynthesis, as precursor molecules for the synthesis of various cellular products, and as signaling molecules. Defects in lipid synthesis or processing contribute to the development of many diseases, including obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cancer. Studies published over the last few years have shown that the target of rapamycin (TOR), a conserved serine/threonine kinase with an important role in regulating cell growth, controls lipid biosynthesis through various mechanisms. Here, we review these findings and briefly discuss their potential relevance for human health and disease."
31861911,"Statin-Related Myotoxicity: A Comprehensive Review of Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacogenomic and Muscle Components","Abstract:Statins are a cornerstone in the pharmacological prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although generally well tolerated, a small subset of patients experience statin-related myotoxicity (SRM). SRM is heterogeneous in presentation; phenotypes include the relatively more common myalgias, infrequent myopathies, and rare rhabdomyolysis. Very rarely, statins induce an anti-HMGCR positive immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy. Diagnosing SRM in clinical practice can be challenging, particularly for mild SRM that is frequently due to alternative aetiologies and the nocebo effect. Nevertheless, SRM can directly harm patients and lead to statin discontinuation/non-adherence, which increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Several factors increase systemic statin exposure and predispose to SRM, including advanced age, concomitant medications, and the nonsynonymous variant, rs4149056, in SLCO1B1, which encodes the hepatic sinusoidal transporter, OATP1B1. Increased exposure of skeletal muscle to statins increases the risk of mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium signalling disruption, reduced prenylation, atrogin-1 mediated atrophy and pro-apoptotic signalling. Rare variants in several metabolic myopathy genes including CACNA1S, CPT2, LPIN1, PYGM and RYR1 increase myopathy/rhabdomyolysis risk following statin exposure. The immune system is implicated in both conventional statin intolerance/myotoxicity via LILRB5 rs12975366, and a strong association exists between HLA-DRB1*11:01 and anti-HMGCR positive myopathy. Epigenetic factors (miR-499-5p, miR-145) have also been implicated in statin myotoxicity. SRM remains a challenge to the safe and effective use of statins, although consensus strategies to manage SRM have been proposed. Further research is required, including stringent phenotyping of mild SRM through N-of-1 trials coupled to systems pharmacology omics- approaches to identify novel risk factors and provide mechanistic insight.

32431707,Lipin-1 Contributes to IL-4 Mediated Macrophage Polarization,"Abstract:Macrophage responses contribute to a diverse array of pathologies ranging from infectious disease to sterile inflammation. Polarization of macrophages determines their cellular function within biological processes. Lipin-1 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase in which its enzymatic activity contributes to macrophage pro-inflammatory responses. Lipin-1 also possesses transcriptional co-regulator activity and whether this activity is required for macrophage polarization is unknown. Using mice that lack only lipin-1 enzymatic activity or both enzymatic and transcriptional coregulator activities from myeloid cells, we investigated the contribution of lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulator function toward macrophage wound healing polarization. Macrophages lacking both lipin-1 activities did not elicit IL-4 mediated gene expression to levels seen in either wild-type or lipin-1 enzymatically deficient macrophages. Furthermore, mice lacking myeloid-associated lipin-1 have impaired full thickness excisional wound healing compared to wild-type mice or mice only lacking lipin-1 enzymatic activity from myeloid cell. Our study provides evidence that lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulatory activity contributes to macrophage polarization and influences wound healing in vivo.              Keywords:                    lipin-1; macrophage; polarization; transcriptional coregulator; wound healing."
20692363,Lipin - The bridge between hepatic glycerolipid biosynthesis and lipoprotein metabolism,"Abstract:Growing evidence links the three mammalian lipin proteins, i.e., lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3, to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases such as noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Lipin proteins play a dual function in lipid metabolism by acting as phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes and as transcriptional regulators. Genetic variants within the human LPIN1 and LPIN2 genes are associated with metabolic syndromes. The fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mice carrying mutations within the Lpin1 gene display life-long deficiency in adipogenesis, insulin resistance, neonatal hepatosteatosis and hypertriglyceridemia, as well as increased atherosclerosis susceptibility. Cell culture studies show that hepatic lipin-1 expression is selectively stimulated by glucocorticoids and repressed by insulin, and its subcellular localization governs the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). In noninsulin-dependent diabetes, glucocorticoid signals lead to dyslipidemia characterized by overproduction of VLDL and atherogenic remnants. This puts lipin-1 as a key integrator of hormonal signals to the liver in diabetic dyslipidemia. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role that hepatic lipin-1 plays in the synthesis, storage and compartmentalization of glycerolipids, and highlights the lipid metabolic consequences associated with dysregulated lipin expression."
34256308,Myeloid-associated lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulatory activity is atheroprotective,"Abstract                        Background and aims:                    Atherosclerosis is the most prominent underlying cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is initiated by cholesterol deposition in the arterial intima, which causes macrophage recruitment and proinflammatory responses that promote plaque growth, necrotic core formation, and plaque rupture. Lipin-1 is a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase for glycerolipid synthesis. We have shown that lipin-1 phosphatase activity promotes macrophage pro-inflammatory responses when stimulated with modified low-density lipoprotein (modLDL) and accelerates atherosclerosis. Lipin-1 also independently acts as a transcriptional co-regulator where it enhances the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation. In hepatocytes and adipocytes, lipin-1 augments the activity of transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARs). PPARs control the expression of anti-inflammatory genes in macrophages and slow or reduce atherosclerotic progression. Therefore, we hypothesize myeloid-derived lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulatory activity reduces atherosclerosis.              Methods:                    We used myeloid-derived lipin-1 knockout (lipin-1mKO) and littermate control mice and AAV8-PCSK9 along with high-fat diet to elicit atherosclerosis.              Results:                    Lipin-1mKO mice had larger aortic root plaques than littermate control mice after 8 and 12 weeks of a high-fat diet. Lipin-1mKO mice also had increased serum proinflammatory cytokine concentrations, reduced apoptosis in plaques, and larger necrotic cores in the plaques compared to control mice.              Conclusions:                    Combined, the data suggest lipin-1 transcriptional co-regulatory activity in myeloid cells is atheroprotective.

26278388,Signal Transduction Mechanisms of Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Emer ging Role of Lipin-1,"Abstract:Lipin-1, a mammalian phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP), is a bi-functional molecule involved in various signaling pathways via its function as a PAP enzyme in the triglyceride synthesis pathway and in the nucleus as a transcriptional co-regulator. In the liver, lipin-1 is known to play a vital role in controlling the lipid metabolism and inflammation process at multiple regulatory levels. Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is one of the earliest forms of liver injury and approximately 8-20% of patients with simple steatosis can develop into more severe forms of liver injury, including steatohepatitis, fibrosis/ cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The signal transduction mechanisms for alcohol-induced detrimental effects in liver involves alteration of complex and multiple signaling pathways largely governed by a central and upstream signaling system, namely, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-AMP activated kinase (AMPK) axis. Emerging evidence suggests a pivotal role of lipin-1 as a crucial downstream regulator of SIRT1-AMPK signaling system that is likely to be ultimately responsible for development and progression of AFLD. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that ethanol exposure significantly induces lipin-1 gene and protein expression levels in cultured hepatocytes and in the livers of rodents, induces lipin-1-PAP activity, impairs the functional activity of nuclear lipin-1, disrupts lipin-1 mRNA alternative splicing and induces lipin-1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Such impairment in response to ethanol leads to derangement of hepatic lipid metabolism, and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines in the livers of the rodents and human alcoholics. This review summarizes current knowledge about the role of lipin-1 in the pathogenesis of AFLD and its potential signal transduction mechanisms.

27109161,Lipin1-Mediated Repression of Adipogenesis by Rutin,"Abstract:Rutin, also called rutoside or quercetin-3-O-rutinoside and sophorin, is a glycoside between the flavonol quercetin and the disaccharide rutinose. Although many effects of rutin have been reported in vitro and in vivo, the anti-adipogenic effects of rutin have not been fully reported. The aim of this study was to confirm how rutin regulates adipocyte related factors. In this study, rutin decreased the expressions of adipogenesis-related genes, including peroxisome proliferators, activated receptor [Formula: see text] (PPAR[Formula: see text], CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein [Formula: see text] (C/EBP[Formula: see text], fatty acid synthase, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, and lipoprotein lipase in 3T3-L1 cells. Rutin also repressed the expression of lipin1, which is an upstream regulator that controls PPAR[Formula: see text] and C/EBP[Formula: see text]. In addition, when 3T3-L1 was transfected with lipin1 siRNA to block lipin1 function, rutin did not affect the expressions of PPAR[Formula: see text] and C/EBP[Formula: see text]. These results suggest that rutin has an anti-adipogenic effect that acts through the suppression of lipin1, as well as PPAR[Formula: see text] and C/EBP[Formula: see text].

18023282,The lipin protein family: dual roles in lipid biosynthesis and gene expression,"Abstract:The prevalence of obesity in the western world has focused attention on factors that influence triglyceride biosynthesis, storage, and utilization. Members of the lipin protein family have a newly discovered enzymatic role in triglyceride and phospholipid biosynthesis as a phosphatidate phosphatase, and also act as an inducible transcriptional coactivator in conjunction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) coactivator-1 alpha and PPAR alpha. Through these activities, the founding member of the family, lipin-1, influences lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in diverse tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. The physiological roles of lipin-2 and lipin-3 are less well defined, but are likely to carry out similar functions in glycerolipid biosynthesis and gene expression in a distinct tissue distribution."

35749715,Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 promotes the adipogenesis of intramuscular preadipocytes in goat,"Abstract:Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) is the key enzyme that catalyzes the last step of triglyceride synthesis. However, its role in intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in goat remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of DGAT2 in regulating goat IMF deposition. In the present study, the expression of DGAT2 was highest in goat triceps brachii, and highest on the first day after oleic acid induction in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. The overexpression of DGAT2 promoted the accumulation of lipid droplets and triglyceride synthesis, accompanied by the expression upregulation of DGAT1, TIP47, ACC and ACOX1 significantly, and expression downregulation of AGPAT6, LPIN1, LPL, HSL, ATGL and ADRP significantly. In contrast, the silencing of DGAT2 decreased the accumulation of lipid droplets, inhibited the expression of DGAT1, GPAM, ADRP, AGPAT6, LPL, HSL, ATGL, ACC, FASN, ACOX1 significantly, and enhanced that of TIP47 significantly. Overall, these data underscore DGAT2 may play a potentially important role in lipid droplets formation and triglyceride accumulation, so as to maintain intramuscular fat deposition, beyond triglyceride synthesis in goat.

15753971,Biphasic expression of lipin suggests dual roles in adipocyte development,"Abstract:The identification of gene mutations that cause lipodystrophies, conditions characterized by a lack of normal adipose tissue, has revealed new proteins that play a role in adipocyte biology. Lipin is one such protein identified in a lipodystrophic mouse strain and found to be critical for normal adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, lipin displays a biphasic expression pattern in adipocytes, with peaks of expression at two points during adipogenesis--a transient induction in preadipocytes prior to expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and a second wave of expression in mature adipocytes. Thus, lipin appears to have critical roles in both adipocyte differentiation and in the function of mature adipocytes."
31948492,Variation in the yak lipin-1 gene and its association with milk traits,"Abstract:The aim of this research was to identify variation in the yak lipin-1 gene (LPIN1) and determine whether this variation affects milk traits. PCR-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis was used to detect variation in the 5' untranslated region of LPIN1 in 500 yaks from four populations: Tianzhu white yaks, Qinghai yaks, wild × domestic-cross yaks and Gannan yaks. Four unique PCR-SSCP patterns, representing four different DNA sequence variants (named A, B, C and D), were observed. These contained six single nucleotide polymorphisms. Female Gannan yaks with BC genotype produced milk with a higher fat content (P < 0.001) and total milk solids (P < 0.001), than those with the AA, AB and BB genotypes. These results would suggest that LPIN1 is having an effect on yak milk fat synthesis.              Keywords:                    LPIN1; milk traits; polymorphism; yak."

28467182,Roles of silent information regulator 1-serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 10-lipin 1 axis in the pathogenesis of alcohol fatty liver disease,"Abstract:Alcohol exposure is a major reason of morbidity and mortality all over the world, with much of detrimental consequences attributing to alcoholic liver disease (ALD). With the continued ethanol consumption, alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD, the earliest and reversible form of ALD) can further develop to more serious forms of alcoholic liver damage, including alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis/cirrhosis, and even eventually progress to hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. Furthermore, cell trauma, inflammation, oxidative stress, regeneration, and bacterial translocation are crucial promoters of ethanol-mediated liver lesions. AFLD is characterized by excessive fat deposition in liver induced by excessive drinking, which is related closely to the raised synthesis of fatty acids and triglyceride, reduction of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, and the aggregation of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Although little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AFLD, it seems to be correlated to diverse signal channels. Massive studies have suggested that liver steatosis is closely associated with the inhibition of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and the augment of lipin1 β/α ratio mediated by ethanol. Recently, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 10 (SFRS10), a specific molecule functioning in alternative splicing of lipin 1 (LPIN1) pre-mRNAs, has emerged as the central connection between SIRT1 and lipin1 signaling. It seems a new signaling axis, SIRT1-SFRS10-LPIN1 axis, acting in the pathogenesis of AFLD exists. This article aims to further explore the interactions among the above three molecules and their influences on the development of AFLD. Impact statement ALD is a major health burden in industrialized countries as well as China. AFLD, the earliest and reversible form of ALD, can progress to hepatitis, fibrosis/cirrhosis, even hepatoma. While the mechanisms, by which ethanol consumption leads to AFLD, are complicated and multiple, and remain incompletely understood. SIRT1, SFRS10, and LIPIN1 had been separately reported to participate in lipid metabolism and the pathogenesis of AFLD. Noteworthy, we found the connection among them via searching articles in PubMed and we had elaborated the connection in detail in this minireview. It seems a new signaling axis, SIRT1-SFRS10-LIPIN1 axis, acting in the pathogenesis of AFLD exists. Further study aimed at SIRT1-SFRS10-LIPIN1 signaling system will possibly offer a more effective therapeutic target for AFLD.

35649414,Functional roles for AGPAT6 in milk fat synthesis of buffalo mammary epithelial cells,"Abstract:AGPAT6 plays a crucial role in the triglyceride (TG) synthesis pathway in mammals. However, its roles in buffalo lactation remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated the functional roles of AGPAT6 in milk fat synthesis by transfecting overexpression and lentivirus interference vectors in buffalo mammary epithelial cells (BuMECs) in vitro. AGPAT6 overexpression in BuMECs significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of FABP4, SLC27A6, ACSL1, DGAT1, DGAT2, LPIN1, INSIG1, CEBPA and SREBF1 genes, and significantly reduced that of XDH, CPT1A, LIPE, INSIG2 and PPARGC1A, but has no significant influence to the mRNA abundance of FABP3, GPAM, PPARG and SREBF2. However, the interference with AGPAT6, the mRNA expression of FABP4, SLC27A6, ACSL1, DGAT1, DGAT2, INSIG1, CEBPA, SREBF1, XDH, CPT1A, LIPE, INSIG2 and PPARGC1A genes in BuMECs changed contrary to the overexpression experiment, and that of GPAM, PPARG and SREBF2 also did not change significantly, but the expression of FABP3 was significantly decreased. In addition, the overexpression/interference of AGPAT6 gene significantly increased/decreased TG content in BuMECs. The results here indicate that AGPAT6 gene is involved in TG synthesis in BuMECs, and affects the expression of major genes associated with FA transport and activation, TG synthesis and transcription regulation, FA oxidation and TG degradation during the lipogenesis of milk.

26658689,Lipin-1 expression is critical for keratinocyte differentiation,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is an Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase that facilitates the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to generate diacylglycerol. Little is known about the expression and function of lipin-1 in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). Here, we demonstrate that lipin-1 is present in basal and spinous layers of the normal human epidermis, and lipin-1 expression is gradually downregulated during NHEK differentiation. Interestingly, lipin-1 knockdown (KD) inhibited keratinocyte differentiation and caused G1 arrest by upregulating p21 expression. Cell cycle arrest by p21 is required for commitment of keratinocytes to differentiation, but must be downregulated for the progress of keratinocyte differentiation. Therefore, reduced keratinocyte differentiation results from sustained upregulation of p21 by lipin-1 KD. Lipin-1 KD also decreased the phosphorylation/activation of protein kinase C (PKC)α, whereas lipin-1 overexpression increased PKCα phosphorylation. Treatment with PKCα inhibitors, like lipin-1 KD, stimulated p21 expression, while lipin-1 overexpression reduced p21 expression, implicating PKCα in lipin-1-induced regulation of p21 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that lipin-1-mediated downregulation of p21 is critical for the progress of keratinocyte differentiation after the initial commitment of keratinocytes to differentiation induced by p21, and that PKCα is involved in p21 expression regulation by lipin-1.

35672379,Deletion of Smurf1 attenuates liver steatosis via stabilization of p53,"Abstract:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease, characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation. Recently, we demonstrated that Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) deficiency significantly alleviates mouse hepatic steatosis. However, the mechanism of Smurf1-regulating hepatic lipid accumulation requires further exploration and clarification. Hence, this study explores the potential mechanism of Smurf1 in hepatic steatosis. In this study, hepatic Smurf1 proteins in NAFLD patients and healthy individuals were determined using immunohistochemical staining. Control and NAFLD mouse models were established by feeding Smurf1-knockout (KO) and wild-type mice with either a high-fat diet (HFD) or a chow diet (CD) for eight weeks. Oleic acid (OA)-induced steatotic hepatocytes were used as the NAFLD mode cells. Lipid content in liver tissues was analyzed. Smurf1-MDM2 interaction, MDM2 and p53 ubiquitination, and p53 target genes expression in liver tissues and hepatocytes were analyzed. We found that hepatic Smurf1 is highly expressed in NAFLD patients and HFD-induced NAFLD mice. Its deletion attenuates hepatocyte steatosis. Mechanistically, Smurf1 interacts with and stabilizes mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), promoting p53 degradation. In Smurf1-deficient hepatocytes, an increase in p53 suppresses SREBP-1c expression and elevates the expression of both malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) and lipin1 (Lpin1), two essential proteins in lipid catabolism. Contrarily, the activities of these three proteins and hepatocyte steatosis are reversed by p53 knockdown in Smurf1-deficient hepatocytes. This study shows that Smurf1 is involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by balancing de novo lipid synthesis and lipolysis."

23627357,Lipin1 regulates PPARγ transcriptional activity,"Abstract:PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ) is a master transcription factor involved in adipogenesis through regulating adipocyte-specific gene expression. Recently, lipin1 was found to act as a key factor for adipocyte maturation and maintenance by modulating the C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α) and PPARγ network; however, the precise mechanism by which lipin1 affects the transcriptional activity of PPARγ is largely unknown. The results of the present study show that lipin1 activates PPARγ by releasing co-repressors, NCoR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor), from PPARγ in the absence of the ligand rosiglitazone. We also identified a novel lipin1 TAD (transcriptional activation domain), between residues 217 and 399, which is critical for the activation of PPARγ, but not PPARα. Furthermore, this TAD is unique to lipin1 since this region does not show any homology with the other lipin isoforms, lipin2 and lipin3. The activity of the lipin1 TAD is enhanced by p300 and SRC-1 (steroid receptor co-activator 1), but not by PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) and PGC-1α (PPAR co-activator 1α). The physical interaction between lipin1 and PPARγ occurs at the lipin1 C-terminal region from residues 825 to 926, and the VXXLL motif at residue 885 is critical for binding with and the activation of PPARγ. The action of lipin1 as a co-activator of PPARγ enhanced adipocyte differentiation; the TAD and VXXLL motif played critical roles, but the catalytic activity of lipin1 was not directly involved. Collectively, these data suggest that lipin1 functions as a key regulator of PPARγ activity through its ability to release co-repressors and recruit co-activators via a mechanism other than PPARα activation."
20735359,Lipin proteins form homo- and hetero-oligomers,"Abstract:Lipin family members (lipin 1, 2 and 3) are bi-functional proteins that dephosphorylate PA (phosphatidic acid) to produce DAG (diacylglycerol) and act in the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Although other components of the triacylglycerol synthesis pathway can form oligomeric complexes, it is unknown whether lipin proteins also exist as oligomers. In the present study, using various approaches, we revealed that lipin 1 formed stable homo-oligomers with itself and hetero-oligomers with lipin 2/3. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of lipin 1 mediate its oligomerization in a head-to-head/tail-to-tail manner. We also show that lipin 1 subcellular localization can be influenced through oligomerization, and the individual lipin 1 monomers in the oligomer function independently in catalysing dephosphorylation of PA. The present study provides evidence that lipin proteins function as oligomeric complexes and that the three mammalian lipin isoforms can form combinatorial units."
35725366,Transcriptome study digs out BMP2 involved in adipogenesis in sheep tails,"Abstract                        Background:                    Hu sheep and Tibetan sheep in China are characterized by fat tails and thin tails, respectively. Several transcriptomes have been conducted in different sheep breeds to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) underlying this trait. However, these studies identified different DEGs in different sheep breeds.              Results:                    Hence, RNA sequencing was performed on Hu sheep and Tibetan sheep. We obtained a total of 45.57 and 43.82 million sequencing reads, respectively. Two libraries mapped reads from 36.93 and 38.55 million reads after alignment to the reference sequences. 2108 DEGs were identified, including 1247 downregulated and 861 upregulated DEGs. GO and KEGG analyses of all DEGs demonstrated that pathways were enriched in the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes and terms related to the chemokine signalling pathway, lysosomes, and glycosaminoglycan degradation. Eight genes were selected for validation by RT-qPCR. In addition, the transfection of BMP2 overexpression into preadipocytes resulted in increased PPAR-γ expression and expression. BMP2 potentially induces adipogenesis through LOX in preadipocytes. The number of lipid drops in BMP2 overexpression detected by oil red O staining was also greater than that in the negative control.              Conclusion:                    In summary, these results showed that significant genes (BMP2, HOXA11, PPP1CC and LPIN1) are involved in the regulation of adipogenesis metabolism and suggested novel insights into metabolic molecules in sheep fat tails.

In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Phan and Reue (2005) show that overexpression of lipin in either muscle or adipose tissue increases adiposity. Interestingly, mice overexpressing lipin in muscle are insulin resistant, while those overexpressing lipin in adipose tissue are insulin sensitive."

34852214,Cell cycle regulation of ER membrane biogenesis protects against chromosome missegregation,"Abstract:Failure to reorganize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mitosis results in chromosome missegregation. Here, we show that accurate chromosome segregation in human cells requires cell cycle-regulated ER membrane production. Excess ER membranes increase the viscosity of the mitotic cytoplasm to physically restrict chromosome movements, which impedes the correction of mitotic errors leading to the formation of micronuclei. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the protein phosphatase CTDNEP1 counteracts mTOR kinase to establish a dephosphorylated pool of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin 1 in interphase. CTDNEP1 control of lipin 1 limits the synthesis of fatty acids for ER membrane biogenesis in interphase that then protects against chromosome missegregation in mitosis. Thus, regulation of ER size can dictate the biophysical properties of mitotic cells, providing an explanation for why ER reorganization is necessary for mitotic fidelity. Our data further suggest that dysregulated lipid metabolism is a potential source of aneuploidy in cancer cells.

30642635,Lipin-1 is a novel substrate of protein phosphatase PGAM5,"Abstract:Lipin-1 has multiple functions that regulate lipid and energy metabolism according to its subcellular localization. The subcellular localization of Lipin-1 is determined by kinase-dependent phosphorylation; however, the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates Lipin-1 has remained elusive. Using an immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS approach we have identified phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5), a serine/threonine specific protein phosphatase, as a regulator of Lipin-1 activity. Treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), which activates endogenous PGAM5, promoted dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Lipin-1. Our findings further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate Lipin-1.

34354069,The middle lipin domain adopts a membrane-binding dimeric protein fold,"Abstract:Phospholipid synthesis and fat storage as triglycerides are regulated by lipin phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAPs), whose enzymatic PAP function requires association with cellular membranes. Using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find mouse lipin 1 binds membranes through an N-terminal amphipathic helix, the Ig-like domain and HAD phosphatase catalytic core, and a middle lipin (M-Lip) domain that is conserved in mammalian and mammalian-like lipins. Crystal structures of the M-Lip domain reveal a previously unrecognized protein fold that dimerizes. The isolated M-Lip domain binds membranes both in vitro and in cells through conserved basic and hydrophobic residues. Deletion of the M-Lip domain in lipin 1 reduces PAP activity, membrane association, and oligomerization, alters subcellular localization, diminishes acceleration of adipocyte differentiation, but does not affect transcriptional co-activation. This establishes the M-Lip domain as a dimeric protein fold that binds membranes and is critical for full functionality of mammalian lipins."
32087966,Lipin1 mediates cognitive impairment in fld mice via PKD-ERK pathway,"Abstract:Lipin1 is important in lipid synthesis because of its phosphatidate phosphatase activity, and it also functions as transcriptional coactivators to regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. We found that fld mice exhibit cognitive impairment, and it is related to the DAG-PKD-ERK pathway. We used fld mice to explore the relationship between lipin1 and cognitive function. Our results confirmed the presence of cognitive impairment in the hippocampus of lipin1-deficient mice. As shown in behavioral test, the spatial learning and memory ability of fld mice was much worse than that of wild-type mice. Electron microscopy results showed that the number of synapses in hippocampus of fld mice was significantly reduced. BDNF,SYP, PSD95 were significantly reduced. These results suggest that lipin1 impairs synaptic plasticity. Hence,a deficiency of lipin1 leads to decreased DAG levels and inhibits PKD activation, thereby affecting the phosphorylation of ERK and the CREB.

27453503,Torsins Are Essential Regulators of Cellular Lipid Metabolism,"Abstract:Torsins are developmentally essential AAA+ proteins, and mutation of human torsinA causes the neurological disease DYT1 dystonia. They localize in the ER membranes, but their cellular function remains unclear. We now show that dTorsin is required in Drosophila adipose tissue, where it suppresses triglyceride levels, promotes cell growth, and elevates membrane lipid content. We also see that human torsinA at the inner nuclear membrane is associated with membrane expansion and elevated cellular lipid content. Furthermore, the key lipid metabolizing enzyme, lipin, is mislocalized in dTorsin-KO cells, and dTorsin increases levels of the lipin substrate, phosphatidate, and reduces the product, diacylglycerol. Finally, genetic suppression of dLipin rescues dTorsin-KO defects, including adipose cell size, animal growth, and survival. These findings identify that torsins are essential regulators of cellular lipid metabolism and implicate disturbed lipid biology in childhood-onset DYT1 dystonia."
36224382,Identification and analysis of dysregulated fatty acid metabolism genes in breast cancer subtypes,"Abstract:Breast cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal types of transformation among women. An anomaly of normal fatty acid metabolism is acknowledged as a critical trigger for malignant transformations including breast cancer, but the prospect of targeting fatty acid metabolism for the treatment of malignancy has remained unrecognized so far. It has been observed that specific fatty acid metabolism genes are involved in the commencement and development of breast cancer. These specific genes have also been observed to be related to different isotypes/molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The main purpose of this study was to scrutinize the prognostic significance, functional role, and expression pattern of fatty acid metabolism genes. In-Silico tools like TCGA BrCA, Gepia2, Ualcan Analysis, UCSC Xena, Kaplan-Meier plotter, Bc-gene EXminer, String, gene ontology, and KEGG databases, were used to assess the expression pattern of the fatty acid metabolism genes in breast cancer patients and also among the different molecular sub-types of breast cancer. Differential gene expression analysis revealed dysregulation of FABP4, FABP5, PLIN1, ﻿PLIN2, PLIN4, PLIN5, LPIN1, MGLL, PNPLA2, PNPLA7, ACSL1, and ACOX2 showing a fold change > ± 1.5. Also, most of these genes show downregulation in Ualcan analysis of different isotypes/molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The study reveals that the screened genes i.e., FABP4, FABP5, PLIN1, PLIN2, PLIN4, PLIN5, LPIN1, MGLL, PNPLA2, PNPLA7, ACSL1, and ACOX2 can be used as biomarkers that reveal poor prognosis and may serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer.

33775826,Establishment of reporter cells that respond to glucocorticoids by a transposon-mediated promoter-trapping system,"Abstract:Previously, we had established a highly sensitive trap vector system for the efficient isolation of reporter cells for a certain condition of interest. In this study, we used this system to screen reporter cells that express the luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein genes in response to dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid receptor agonist to facilitate glucocorticoid signaling research. In total, 10 clones were isolated. The insertion sites of the trap vector were analyzed using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE), whereupon LPIN1, PKP2, and FKBP5 were identified as genes that were upregulated by the dexamethasone treatment. Specifically, PKP2 has not previously been focused as a gene that responds to glucocorticoids. The PKP2 mRNA was analyzed and induction of the endogenous gene was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Given that PKP2 does not appear to have a consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE) sequence, this reporter clone could supplement the current GRE-based reporter systems that are prevalently used. Because different clones showed different responses to glucocorticoids, these clones should provide more information than analysis with a single reporter clone. This paper demonstrates that the previously developed trap vector technology can contribute to the rapid construction of drug evaluation systems.

24634820,Lipin-1 and lipin-3 together determine adiposity in vivo,"Abstract:The lipin protein family of phosphatidate phosphatases has an established role in triacylglycerol synthesis and storage. Physiological roles for lipin-1 and lipin-2 have been identified, but the role of lipin-3 has remained mysterious. Using lipin single- and double-knockout models we identified a cooperative relationship between lipin-3 and lipin-1 that influences adipogenesis in vitro and adiposity in vivo. Furthermore, natural genetic variations in Lpin1 and Lpin3 expression levels across 100 mouse strains correlate with adiposity. Analysis of PAP activity in additional metabolic tissues from lipin single- and double-knockout mice also revealed roles for lipin-1 and lipin-3 in spleen, kidney, and liver, for lipin-1 alone in heart and skeletal muscle, and for lipin-1 and lipin-2 in lung and brain. Our findings establish that lipin-1 and lipin-3 cooperate in vivo to determine adipose tissue PAP activity and adiposity, and may have implications in understanding the protection of lipin-1-deficient humans from overt lipodystrophy.

33077427,Macrophage-Associated Lipin-1 Promotes β-Oxidation in Response to Proresolving Stimuli,"Abstract:Macrophages reprogram their metabolism to promote appropriate responses. Proresolving macrophages primarily use fatty acid oxidation as an energy source. Metabolites generated during the catabolism of fatty acids aid in the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair, but the regulatory mechanisms that control lipid metabolism in macrophages are not fully elucidated. Lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase that has transcriptional coregulator activity, regulates lipid metabolism in a variety of cells. In this current study, we show that lipin-1 is required for increased oxidative phosphorylation in IL-4 stimulated mouse (Mus musculus) macrophages. We also show that the transcriptional coregulatory function of lipin-1 is required for β-oxidation in response to palmitate (free fatty acid) and apoptotic cell (human) stimulation. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages lacking lipin-1 have a reduction in critical TCA cycle metabolites following IL-4 stimulation, suggesting a break in the TCA cycle that is supportive of lipid synthesis rather than lipid catabolism. Together, our data demonstrate that lipin-1 regulates cellular metabolism in macrophages in response to proresolving stimuli and highlights the importance of aligning macrophage metabolism with macrophage phenotype."
34494556,Lipin 1 modulates mRNA splicing during fasting adaptation in liver,"Abstract:Lipin 1 regulates cellular lipid homeostasis through roles in glycerolipid synthesis (through phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity) and transcriptional coactivation. Lipin 1-deficient individuals exhibit episodic disease symptoms that are triggered by metabolic stress, such as stress caused by prolonged fasting. We sought to identify critical lipin 1 activities during fasting. We determined that lipin 1 deficiency induces widespread alternative mRNA splicing in liver during fasting, much of which is normalized by refeeding. The role of lipin 1 in mRNA splicing was largely independent of its enzymatic function. We identified interactions between lipin 1 and spliceosome proteins, as well as a requirement for lipin 1 to maintain homeostatic levels of spliceosome small nuclear RNAs and specific RNA splicing factors. In fasted Lpin1-/- liver, we identified a correspondence between alternative splicing of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes and dysregulated phospholipid levels; splicing patterns and phospholipid levels were partly normalized by feeding. Thus, lipin 1 influences hepatic lipid metabolism through mRNA splicing, as well as through enzymatic and transcriptional activities, and fasting exacerbates the deleterious effects of lipin 1 deficiency on metabolic homeostasis.

28483528,Degradation of human Lipin-1 by BTRC E3 ubiquitin ligase,"Abstract:Lipin-1 has dual functions in the regulation of lipid and energy metabolism according to its subcellular localization, which is tightly controlled. However, it is unclear how Lipin-1 degradation is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that Lipin-1 is degraded through its DSGXXS motif. We show that Lipin-1 interacts with either of two E3 ubiquitin ligases, BTRC or FBXW11, and that this interaction is DSGXXS-dependent and mediates the attachment of polyubiquitin chains. Further, we demonstrate that degradation of Lipin-1 is regulated by BTRC in the cytoplasm and on membranes. These novel insights into the regulation of human Lipin-1 stability will be useful in planning further studies to elucidate its metabolic processes.

30673611,Gain-of-Function Mutations of SLC16A11 Contribute to the Pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes,"Abstract:DNA variants in the SLC16A11 coding region were identified to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in a Mexican population. Previous studies suggested that these variants disrupt SLC16A11 function and therefore proposed to revive SLC16A11 levels or activity to achieve therapeutic benefit. However, with knockout mouse models, here we show that Slc16a11 depletion has no significant metabolic defects. Further studies demonstrate that reconstitution of the mutant, but not the wild-type Slc16a11, in the liver of knockout mice causes more triglyceride accumulation and induction of insulin resistance via upregulation of lipin 1, suggesting gaining of aberrant functions of the mutant protein that affects lipid metabolism. Our findings offer a different explanation to the function of these diabetic variants, challenging the concept of enhancing SLC16A11 function to treat T2DM. The contradictory results by our and previous studies suggest that how the SLC16A11 locus contributes to human metabolism warrants further investigation.

30420558,Lipin1 deficiency causes sarcoplasmic reticulum stress and chaperone-responsive myopathy,"Abstract:As a consequence of impaired glucose or fatty acid metabolism, bioenergetic stress in skeletal muscles may trigger myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Genetic mutations causing loss of function of the LPIN1 gene frequently lead to severe rhabdomyolysis bouts in children, though the metabolic alterations and possible therapeutic interventions remain elusive. Here, we show that lipin1 deficiency in mouse skeletal muscles is sufficient to trigger myopathy. Strikingly, muscle fibers display strong accumulation of both neutral and phospholipids. The metabolic lipid imbalance can be traced to an altered fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, accompanied by a defect in acyl chain elongation and desaturation. As an underlying cause, we reveal a severe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stress, leading to the activation of the lipogenic SREBP1c/SREBP2 factors, the accumulation of the Fgf21 cytokine, and alterations of SR-mitochondria morphology. Importantly, pharmacological treatments with the chaperone TUDCA and the fatty acid oxidation activator bezafibrate improve muscle histology and strength of lipin1 mutants. Our data reveal that SR stress and alterations in SR-mitochondria contacts are contributing factors and potential intervention targets of the myopathy associated with lipin1 deficiency.

34757442,Lipin-1-derived diacylglycerol activates intracellular TRPC3 which is critical for inflammatory signaling,"Abstract:Exposure to Gram-negative bacterial LPS exacerbates host immune responses and may lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition. Despite its high mortality and morbidity, no drugs specifically directed to treating sepsis are currently available. Using human cell genetic depletion, pharmacological inhibition, live-cell microscopy and organelle-targeted molecular sensors we present evidence that the channel TRPC3 is activated intracellularly during macrophage exposure to LPS and is essential for Ca2+ release from internal stores. In this manner, TRPC3 participates in cytosolic Ca2+ elevations, activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and cytokine upregulation. We also report that TRPC3 is activated by diacylglycerol generated by the phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin-1. In accord with this, lipin-1-deficient cells exhibit reduced Ca2+ responses to LPS challenge. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of TRPC3 reduces systemic inflammation induced by LPS in mice. Collectively, our study unveils a central component of LPS-triggered Ca2+ signaling that involves intracellular sensing of lipin-1-derived DAG by TRPC3, and opens new opportunities for the development of strategies to treat LPS-driven inflammation.

36899741,Non-Synonymous Variants in Fat QTL Genes among High- and Low-Milk-Yielding Indigenous Breeds,"Abstract:The effect of breed on milk components-fat, protein, lactose, and water-has been observed to be significant. As fat is one of the major price-determining factors for milk, exploring the variations in fat QTLs across breeds would shed light on the variable fat content in their milk. Here, on whole-genome sequencing, 25 differentially expressed hub or bottleneck fat QTLs were explored for variations across indigenous breeds. Out of these, 20 genes were identified as having nonsynonymous substitutions. A fixed SNP pattern in high-milk-yielding breeds in comparison to low-milk-yielding breeds was identified in the genes GHR, TLR4, LPIN1, CACNA1C, ZBTB16, ITGA1, ANK1, and NTG5E and, vice versa, in the genes MFGE8, FGF2, TLR4, LPIN1, NUP98, PTK2, ZTB16, DDIT3, and NT5E.

32461215,Lipid-associated PML structures assemble nuclear lipid droplets containing CCTα and Lipin1,"Abstract:Nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) form on the inner nuclear membrane by a mechanism involving promyelocytic leukemia (PML), the protein scaffold of PML nuclear bodies. We report that PML structures on nLDs in oleate-treated U2OS cells, referred to as lipid-associated PML structures (LAPS), differ from canonical PML nuclear bodies by the relative absence of SUMO1, SP100, and DAXX. These nLDs were also enriched in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα), the phosphatidic acid phosphatase Lipin1, and DAG. Translocation of CCTα onto nLDs was mediated by its α-helical M-domain but was not correlated with its activator DAG. High-resolution imaging revealed that CCTα and LAPS occupied distinct polarized regions on nLDs. PML knockout U2OS (PML KO) cells lacking LAPS had a 40-50% reduction in nLDs with associated CCTα, and residual nLDs were almost devoid of Lipin1 and DAG. As a result, phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol synthesis was inhibited in PML KO cells. We conclude that in response to excess exogenous fatty acids, LAPS are required to assemble nLDs that are competent to recruit CCTα and Lipin1."
32978841,The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: an interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers,"Abstract                        Background and purpose:                    Rhabdomyolysis is a medical emergency characterized by acute skeletal muscle breakdown with a sudden rise and subsequent fall of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. Rhabdomyolysis events are provoked by exposure to external triggers, possibly in combination with an increased genetic susceptibility. We aimed to describe comprehensively the external triggers and potentially pathogenic genetic variants possibly implicated in increased rhabdomyolysis susceptibility.              Methods:                    We performed a retrospective single-center study, including a total of 1302 patients with an acute CK level exceeding 2000 IU/l.              Results:                    Anoxia was the most frequently reported trigger (40%). A subset of 193 patients were clinically suspected of an underlying genetic disorder (recurrent episodes, a positive family history, very high or persistently increased CK levels). In 72 of these patients, an unequivocal genetic defect was identified. A total of 22 genes with pathogenic variants were identified, including 52 different variants. Of those, 11 genes have been previously associated with rhabdomyolysis (ACADVL, ANO5, CPT2, DMD, DYSF, FKRP, HADHA, PGM1, LPIN1, PYGM, RYR1). Eleven genes are probably implicated in increased susceptibility (including AGL, CAPN3, CNBP, DMPK, MAGT1, ACADM, SCN4A, SGCA, SGCG, SMPD1, TANGO2).              Conclusion:                    These findings suggest that the spectrum of genetic susceptibility for rhabdomyolysis has not yet been completely clarified. With the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing in a diagnostic setting, we expect that in more cases a genetic defect will be identified.

16054046,"Lipin, a lipodystrophy and obesity gene","Abstract:Lipodystrophy and obesity represent extreme and opposite ends of the adiposity spectrum and have typically been attributed to alterations in the expression or function of distinct sets of genes. We previously demonstrated that lipin deficiency impairs adipocyte differentiation and causes lipodystrophy in the mouse. Using two different tissue-specific lipin transgenic mouse strains, we now demonstrate that enhanced lipin expression in either adipose tissue or skeletal muscle promotes obesity. This occurs through diverse mechanisms in the two tissues, with lipin levels in adipose tissue influencing the fat storage capacity of the adipocyte, and lipin levels in skeletal muscle acting as a determinant of whole-body energy expenditure and fat utilization. Thus, variations in lipin levels alone are sufficient to induce extreme states of adiposity and may represent a mechanism by which adipose tissue and skeletal muscle modulate fat mass and energy balance."
25974997,Changes of lipin1β expression in gestational diabetes mellitus,"Abstract                        Background:                    Lipin1β is an adipokine proposed to be associated with insulin resistance (IR). Pregnancy is a physiologic state of progressive IR. The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of lipin1β in the development of GDM.              Methods:                    A total of 40 pregnant women (22 normal and 18 with GDM) who delivered healthy infants at full-term (> 37 weeks gestation) were included. The mRNA and protein levels of lipin1β in adipose tissues were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western-blot. Plasma glucose, lipids, insulin, and estradiol (E2) levels were measured routinely at fasting state, and HOMA-IR was calculated accordingly.              Results:                    The lipin1β expression in both mRNA and protein levels in SAT and VAT was lower in GDM patients than controls. Lipin1β mRNA in VAT was negatively correlated with BMI (r = -0.505, p < 0.05), FINS (r = -0.539, p < 0.05), HOMA-IR (r = -0.574, p < 0.01), TG (r = -0.471, p < 0.05), and E2 (r = -0.564, p < 0.01). Lipin1β mRNA expression in SAT was similar with VAT. Lipin1β mRNA was not correlated with body weight gain or blood pressure. These results indicated that the lipin1β expression in adipose tissues is down-regulated in patients with GDM.              Conclusions:                    Lipin1β might play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in GDM."
33300687,"Use of dexamethasone in idiopathic, acute pediatric rhabdomyolysis","Abstract:Current rhabdomyolysis treatment guidelines vary based on the etiology and diagnosis, yet many cases evade conclusive diagnosis. In these cases, treatment options remain largely limited to fluids and supportive therapy. We present two cases of acute rhabdomyolysis diagnosed in the emergency department: a 5-year-old boy with sudden onset bilateral flank pain, and a 13-year-old boy with 2-3 days of worsening pectoral and shoulder pain. Each patient had a prior similar episode requiring hospitalization in the past. The 5-year-old had no inciting trauma or trigger, medication use, or illness. The 13-year-old previously had an upper respiratory infection during the week prior and had been strenuously exercising at the time of onset. Genetic testing results were unknown for both patients during their hospitalizations, and insurance and other barriers led to delay. Later results for the first patient revealed a heterozygous deletion in intron 19 on the LPIN1 gene interpreted as a variant of unknown significance. During their hospitalizations, both children were started on intravenous (i.v.) fluids, and creatine kinase (CK) initially trended downward, but then began to rise or plateau. After reviewing the cases, prior literature, and anecdotal evidence of benefit from corticosteroid therapy in rhabdomyolysis with our consultant metabolic physicians, dexamethasone was initiated. In both patients, dexamethasone use correlated with relief of patient symptoms, significantly decreased CK value, and our ability to discharge these patients home quickly. Our cases, discussion, and literature review all lead to the consideration of the use of dexamethasone in conjunction with standard therapy for acute rhabdomyolysis.

35122680,A comprehensive analysis of age-related metabolomics and transcriptomics reveals metabolic alterations in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells,"Abstract:The functions of stem cells decline progressively with aging, and some metabolic changes occur during the process. However, the molecular mechanisms of stem cell aging remain unclear. In this study, the combined application of metabolomics and transcriptomics technologies can effectively describe the possible molecular mechanisms of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) senescence. Metabolomic profiles revealed 23 differential metabolites which were abundant in ""glycerophospholipid metabolism"", ""linoleic acid metabolism"" and ""biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids"". In addition, transcriptomics analysis identified 590 genes with enormously differential expressions in young and old BMSCs. KEGG enrichment analyses showed that metabolism-related pathways in BMSC senescence had stronger responses. Furthermore, the integrated analysis of the interactions between the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites indicated the differential genes related to lipid metabolism of Scd, Scd2, Dgat2, Fads2, Lpin1, Gpat3, Acaa2, Lpcat3, Pcyt2 and Pla2g4a may be closely associated with the aging of BMSCs. Finally, Scd2 was identified as the most significant DEG, and Scd2 over-expression could alleviate cellular senescence in aged BMSCs. In conclusion, this work provides a validated understanding that the DEGs and metabolites related to lipid metabolism present more apparent changes in the senescence of rat BMSCs.

24205284,Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase beta regulates mTOR signaling,"Abstract:Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT-β) is a phosphatidic acid (PA) generating enzyme that plays an essential role in triglyceride synthesis. However, LPAAT-β is now being studied as an important regulator of cell growth and differentiation and as a potential therapeutic target in cancer since PA is necessary for the activity of key proteins such as Raf, PKC-ζ and mTOR. In this report we determine the effect of LPAAT-β silencing with siRNA in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. We show for the first time that LPAAT-β knockdown inhibits proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells. This is associated with inhibition of signaling by mTOR as determined by levels of mTORC1- and mTORC2-specific phosphorylation sites on 4E-BP1, S6K and Akt. Since PA regulates the activity of mTOR by modulating its binding to FKBP38, we explored the possibility that LPAAT-β might regulate mTOR by affecting its association with FKBP38. Coimmunoprecipitation studies of FKBP38 with mTOR show increased levels of FKBP38 associated with mTOR when LPAAT-β protein levels are knocked down. Furthermore, depletion of LPAAT-β results in increased Lipin 1 nuclear localization which is associated with increased nuclear eccentricity, a nuclear shape change that is dependent on mTOR, further confirming the ability of LPAAT-β to regulate mTOR function. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that PA generated by LPAAT-β regulates mTOR signaling. We discuss the implications of these findings for using LPAAT-β as a therapeutic target."
28717649,Circular RNA Profiling and Bioinformatic Modeling Identify Its Regulatory Role in Hepatic Steatosis,"Abstract:Circular RNAs (circRNAs) exhibit a wide range of physiological and pathological activities. To uncover their role in hepatic steatosis, we investigated the expression profile of circRNAs in HepG2-based hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat stimulation. Differentially expressed circRNAs were subjected to validation using QPCR and functional analyses using principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, target prediction, gene ontology (GO), and pathway annotation, respectively. Bioinformatic integration established the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network so as to identify the mechanisms underlying circRNAs' metabolic effect. Here we reported that hepatic steatosis was associated with a total of 357 circRNAs. Enrichment of transcription-related GOs, especially GO: 0006355, GO: 004589, GO: 0045944, GO: 0045892, and GO: 0000122, demonstrated their specific actions in transcriptional regulation. Lipin 1 (LPIN1) was recognized to mediate the transcriptional regulatory effect of circRNAs on metabolic pathways. circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network further identified the signaling cascade of circRNA_021412/miR-1972/LPIN1, which was characterized by decreased level of circRNA_021412 and miR-1972-based inhibition of LPIN1. LPIN1-induced downregulation of long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) expression finally resulted in the hepatosteatosis. These findings identify circRNAs to be important regulators of hepatic steatosis. Transcription-dependent modulation of metabolic pathways may underlie their effects, partially by the circRNA_021412/miR-1972/LPIN1 signaling."
32319636,Hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α regulates Lipin1 differently in pre‑adipocytes and mature adipocytes,"Abstract:Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is a transcription factor that is activated in low oxygen conditions. Adipose tissues are poorly oxygenated in patients with obesity. The low oxygen conditions in obese adipose tissues induce HIF‑1α in adipocytes. Previous studies using genetically modified mice suggest that HIF‑1α contributes to dysfunction in adipocytes. Lipin1 is a bifunctional protein that works as a phosphatidate phosphatase and transcriptional coactivator, which regulates lipid metabolism and adipogenesis, respectively. HIF‑1α directly regulates Lipin1 in hepatocytes. However, the regulation of Lipin1 by HIF‑1α in adipocytes is not well determined. Therefore, the present study investigated the regulation of Lipin1 by HIF‑1α in adipocytes. Expression levels of Lipin1 were reduced in epididymal adipose tissues of adipocyte‑specific HIF‑1α knockout mice, indicating that HIF‑1α regulates Lipin1 in adipocytes. In differentiated mature adipocytes, a HIF‑1α activator, dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG), was demonstrated to increase Lipin1, and a HIF‑1α inhibitor, 3‑(5'‑hydroxymethyl‑2'‑furyl)-1‑benzylindazole (YC‑1), reversed this increase, indicating that HIF‑1α regulates Lipin1 in differentiated adipocytes. However, during differentiation of pre‑adipocytes into adipocytes, YC‑1 increased Lipin1 even though HIF‑1α was decreased. The differentiation efficiency increased with YC‑1 treatment. In addition, DMOG reduced Lipin1 expression levels during differentiation despite increased HIF‑1α. Under these conditions, differentiation efficiency was reduced. These results suggest that Lipin1 is negatively regulated by HIF‑1α in pre‑adipocytes. Our results show that regulation of Lipin1 by HIF‑1α is different in adipocytes and pre‑adipocytes.

31061954,Adipose-Specific Lipin-1 Overexpression Renders Hepatic Ferroptosis and Exacerbates Alcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase involved in the generation of diacylglycerol during synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides. Ethanol-mediated inhibitory effects on adipose-specific lipin-1 expression were associated with experimental steatohepatitis in rodents. In the present study, using an adipose-specific lipin-1 overexpression transgenic (Lpin1-Tg) mouse model, we tested a hypothesis that adipose-specific lipin-1 overexpression in mice might dampen ethanol-induced liver damage. Experimental alcoholic steatohepatitis was induced by pair-feeding ethanol to Lpin1-Tg and wild-type (WT) mice using the chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding protocol. Unexpectedly, following the chronic-plus-binge ethanol challenge, Lpin1-Tg mice exhibited much more pronounced steatosis, exacerbated inflammation, augmented elevation of serum liver enzymes, hepatobiliary damage, and fibrogenic responses compared with the WT mice. Mechanistically, overexpression of adipose lipin-1 in mice facilitated the onset of hepatic ferroptosis, which is an iron-dependent form of cell death, and subsequently induced ferroptotic liver damage in mice under ethanol exposure. Concurrently, adipose lipin-1 overexpression induced defective adiponectin signaling pathways in ethanol-fed mice. Conclusion: We identified ferroptosis as a mechanism in mediating the detrimental effects of adipose-specific lipin-1 overexpression in mice under chronic-plus-binge ethanol exposure. Our present study sheds light on potential therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of human alcoholic steatohepatitis."
22849425,Epineurial adipocytes are dispensable for Schwann cell myelination,"Abstract:Previous clinical observations and data from mouse models with defects in lipid metabolism suggested that epineurial adipocytes may play a role in peripheral nervous system myelination. We have used adipocyte-specific Lpin1 knockout mice to characterize the consequences of the presence of impaired epineurial adipocytes on the myelinating peripheral nerve. Our data revealed that the capacity of Schwann cells to establish myelin, and the functional properties of peripheral nerves, were not affected by compromised epineurial adipocytes in adipocyte-specific Lpin1 knockout mice. To evaluate the possibility that Lpin1-negative adipocytes are still able to support endoneurial Schwann cells, we also characterized sciatic nerves from mice carrying epiblast-specific deletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which develop general lipoatrophy. Interestingly, even the complete loss of adipocytes in the epineurium of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma knockout mice did not lead to detectable defects in Schwann cell myelination. However, probably as a consequence of their hyperglycemia, these mice have reduced nerve conduction velocity, thus mimicking the phenotype observed under diabetic condition. Together, our data indicate that while adipocytes, as regulators of lipid and glucose homeostasis, play a role in nerve function, their presence in epineurium is not essential for establishment or maintenance of proper myelin."
27320911,Cholesterol-Independent SREBP-1 Maturation Is Linked to ARF1 Inactivation,"Abstract:Lipogenesis requires coordinated expression of genes for fatty acid, phospholipid, and triglyceride synthesis. Transcription factors, such as SREBP-1 (Sterol regulatory element binding protein), may be activated in response to feedback mechanisms linking gene activation to levels of metabolites in the pathways. SREBPs can be regulated in response to membrane cholesterol and we also found that low levels of phosphatidylcholine (a methylated phospholipid) led to SBP-1/SREBP-1 maturation in C. elegans or mammalian models. To identify additional regulatory components, we performed a targeted RNAi screen in C. elegans, finding that both lpin-1/Lipin 1 (which converts phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol) and arf-1.2/ARF1 (a GTPase regulating Golgi function) were important for low-PC activation of SBP-1/SREBP-1. Mechanistically linking the major hits of our screen, we find that limiting PC synthesis or LPIN1 knockdown in mammalian cells reduces the levels of active GTP-bound ARF1. Thus, changes in distinct lipid ratios may converge on ARF1 to increase SBP-1/SREBP-1 activity."
32080341,UVB-dependent inhibition of lipin-1 protects against proinflammatory responses in human keratinocytes,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is an Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1) that catalyzes a critical step in the synthesis of glycerophospholipids and is also a cotranscriptional regulator. The role of lipin-1 in the regulation of inflammatory responses has been extensively studied in various cell types but not in skin cells. In the present study, the function of lipin-1 in UVB-induced proinflammatory responses was assessed in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). UVB radiation downregulated lipin-1 expression. Lipin-1 inhibition was mediated by UVB-dependent sterol-response element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) inhibition. The UVB-dependent inhibition of lipin-1 and SREBP-1 was mediated by AMPK activation. UVB-induced activation of JNK was dependent on AMPK activation and mediated lipin-1 inhibition. Prevention of UVB-mediated lipin-1 repression by introducing a lipin-1 expression vector stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 production, suggesting that lipin-1 inhibition attenuates UVB-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production. The downregulation of lipin-1 ameliorated UVB-induced NF-ĸB phosphorylation, which might be attributed to the suppression of UVB-induced accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs). Pharmacological inhibition of PAP1 with propranolol suppressed UVB-induced production of IL-6 and IL-8 in NHEKs and reconstituted human skin models. Taken together, lipin-1 is downregulated by exposure to UVB radiation, which confers protection against UVB-induced proinflammatory responses; therefore, the inhibition of lipin-1 is a potential strategy for photoaging."
33596934,Identification of lipidomic profiles associated with drug-resistant prostate cancer cells,"Abstract                        Background:                    The association of circulating lipids with clinical outcomes of drug-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer (DR-CRPC) is not fully understood. While it is known that increases in select lipids correlate to decreased survival, neither the mechanisms mediating these alterations nor the correlation of resistance to drug treatments is well characterized.              Methods:                    This gap-in-knowledge was addressed using in vitro models of non-cancerous, hormone-sensitive, CRPC and drug-resistant cell lines combined with quantitative LC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS) lipidomic analysis and subsequent analysis such as Metaboanalyst and Lipid Pathway Enrichment Analysis (LIPEA).              Results:                    Several lipid regulatory pathways were identified that are associated with Docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer (PCa). These included those controlling glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid signaling and ferroptosis. In total, 7460 features were identified as being dysregulated between the cell lines studied, and 21 lipid species were significantly altered in drug-resistant cell lines as compared to nonresistant cell lines. Docetaxel resistance cells (PC3-Rx and DU145-DR) had higher levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC), oxidized lipid species, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and sphingomyelin (SM) as compared to parent control cells (PC-3 and DU-145). Alterations were also identified in the levels of phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglyceride (DAG), whose levels are regulated by Lipin (LPIN), a phosphatidic acid phosphatase that converts PA to DAG. Data derived from cBioPortal demonstrated a population of PCa patients expressing mutations aligning with amplification of LPIN1, LPIN2 and LPIN3 genes. Lipin amplification in these genes correlated to decreased survival in these patients. Lipin-1 mRNA expression also showed a similar trend in PCa patient data. Lipin-1, but not Lipin-2 or - 3, was detected in several prostate cancer cells, and was increased in 22RV1 and PC-3 cell lines. The increased expression of Lipin-1 in these cells correlated with the level of PA.              Conclusion:                    These data identify lipids whose levels may correlate to Docetaxel sensitivity and progression of PCa. The data also suggest a correlation between the expression of Lipin-1 in cells and patients with regards to prostate cancer cell aggressiveness and patient survivability. Ultimately, these data may be useful for identifying markers of lethal and/or metastatic prostate cancer.

36778276,Adipocyte lipin 1 is positively associated with metabolic health in humans and regulates systemic metabolism in mice,"Abstract:Dysfunctional adipose tissue is believed to promote the development of hepatic steatosis and systemic insulin resistance, but many of the mechanisms involved are still unclear. Lipin 1 catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol (DAG), the penultimate step of triglyceride synthesis, which is essential for lipid storage. Herein we found that adipose tissue LPIN1 expression is decreased in people with obesity compared to lean subjects and low LPIN1 expression correlated with multi-tissue insulin resistance and increased rates of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Comprehensive metabolic and multi-omic phenotyping demonstrated that adipocyte-specific Lpin1-/- mice had a metabolically-unhealthy phenotype, including liver and skeletal muscle insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and transcriptomic signatures of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis that was exacerbated by high-fat diets. We conclude that adipocyte lipin 1-mediated lipid storage is vital for preserving adipose tissue and systemic metabolic health and its loss predisposes mice to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis."
33123308,Lipin1 Is Involved in the Pathogenesis of Diabetic Encephalopathy through the PKD/Limk/Cofilin Signaling Pathway,"Abstract:Diabetic encephalopathy is a type of central diabetic neuropathy resulting from diabetes mainly manifested as cognitive impairments. However, its underlying pathogenesis and effective treatment strategies remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Lipin1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzyme, on the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy. We found that in vitro, Lipin1 exerts protective effects on high glucose-induced reductions of PC12 cell viability, while in vivo, Lipin1 is downregulated within the CA1 hippocampal region in a type I diabetes rat model. Increased levels of Lipin1 within the CA1 region are accompanied with protective effects including amelioration of dendritic spine and synaptic deficiencies, phosphorylation of the synaptic plasticity-related proteins, LIM kinase 1 (p-limk1) and cofilin, as well as increases in the synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG), and the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase D (p-PKD). These effects are associated with the rescue of cognitive disorders as shown in this rat model of diabetes. In contrast, knockdown of Lipin1 within the CA1 region enhanced neuronal abnormalities and the genesis of cognitive impairment in rats. These results suggest that Lipin1 may exert neuroprotective effects involving the PKD/Limk/Cofilin signaling pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic encephalopathy."
35718147,Lotus seed resistant starch ameliorates high-fat diet induced hyperlipidemia by fatty acid degradation and glycerolipid metabolism pathways in mouse liver,"Abstract:We investigated the potential efficacy and underlying mechanisms of Lotus seed Resistant Starch (LRS) for regulating hyperlipidemia in mice fed a High-fat Diet (HFD). Mouse were fed a normal diet (Normal Control group, NC group), HFD alone (MC group), HFD plus lovastatin (PC group), or HFD with low/medium/high LRS (LLRS, MLRS, and HLRS groups, respectively) for 4 weeks. LRS supplementation significantly decreased body weight and significantly reduced serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipopro-tein cholesterol compared with the MC group. LRS also significantly alleviated hepatic steatosis, especially in the MLRS group, which also showed a significantly reduced visceral fat index. LLRS supplementation significantly regulated genes associated with glycerolipid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis (Lpin1 and Ugt2b38), MLRS significantly regulated genes related to fatty acid degradation, fatty acid elongation, and glycerolipid metabolism (Lpin1, Hadha, Aldh3a2, and Acox1), whereas HLRS significantly regulated genes related to fatty acid elongation and glycerolipid metabolism (Lpin1, Elovl3, Elovol5, and Agpat3). The fatty acid-degradation pathway regulated by MLRS thus exerts better control of serum lipid levels, body weight, visceral fat index, and liver steatosis in mice compared with LLRS- and HLRS-regulated pathways.

32516804,Excess Lipin enzyme activity contributes to TOR1A recessive disease and DYT-TOR1A dystonia,"Abstract:TOR1A/TorsinA mutations cause two incurable diseases: a recessive congenital syndrome that can be lethal, and a dominantly-inherited childhood-onset dystonia (DYT-TOR1A). TorsinA has been linked to phosphatidic acid lipid metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we evaluate the role of phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) enzymes in TOR1A diseases using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from patients, and mouse models of recessive Tor1a disease. We find that Lipin PAP enzyme activity is abnormally elevated in human DYT-TOR1A dystonia patient cells and in the brains of four different Tor1a mouse models. Its severity also correlated with the dosage of Tor1a/TOR1A mutation. We assessed the role of excess Lipin activity in the neurological dysfunction of Tor1a disease mouse models by interbreeding these with Lpin1 knock-out mice. Genetic reduction of Lpin1 improved the survival of recessive Tor1a disease-model mice, alongside suppressing neurodegeneration, motor dysfunction, and nuclear membrane pathology. These data establish that TOR1A disease mutations cause abnormal phosphatidic acid metabolism, and suggest that approaches that suppress Lipin PAP enzyme activity could be therapeutically useful for TOR1A diseases.

30092116,Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis reveals the interacting partners of lipin1,"Abstract:As a lipin family founding member, lipin1 exerts dual functions as a phosphatidate phosphatase enzyme and/or a co-transcriptional regulator in lipid metabolism. In fact, it is also involved in many other cell processes. In this study, we utilized pull down assay coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) to unravel protein-protein interaction networks of lipin1 in 293T human embryonic kidney cells. Pull-down assay on the Ni2+ -chelating column was used to isolate lipin1 complexes from 293T cells transfected with 6-His tagged lipin1. The lipin1 complexes were analyzed on Q Exactive mass spectrometer. A total of 30 proteins were identified from label free quantitation of the MS data by Proteome Discoverer platform. The physical interaction between lipin1 and eEF1A1 was further affirmed in 293T cells transfected with 6-His tagged lipin1 and hepatocyte SMMC7721 cells by protein immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy. Lipin1 also interacted with HIST1H2BK, which was confirmed in SMMC7721 cells by protein immunoprecipitation. Our proteomic analysis implicated lipin1 in novel roles in various cellular processes. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(8):753-762, 2018.

27095772,[Role of lipin-1 in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver disease],"Abstract:Lipin-1 can promote the synthesis of triglyceride and fatty acid oxidation during lipid metabolism. Ethanol can up-regulate the expression of lipin-1 via the AMPK-SREBP-1-lipin-1 signaling pathway and increase lipin1β/αratio via the SITR1-SFRS10-LPIN1 signaling pathway. In the cytoplasm, lipin-1βfunctions as a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase to accelerate the synthesis of triglyceride. In the nucleus, lipin-1αacts as a transcriptional coactivator and reduces mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting the activities of PPARαand PGC-1α, and therefore promotes lipid deposition in hepatocytes and causes hepatic steatosis."
36680547,Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis in lipin-1-deficient patients,"Abstract:Mutations in the LPIN1 gene constitute a major cause of severe rhabdomyolysis (RM). The TLR9 activation prompted us to treat patients with corticosteroids in acute conditions. In patients with LPIN1 mutations, RM and at-risk situations that can trigger RM have been treated in a uniform manner. Since 2015, these patients have also received intravenous corticosteroids. We retrospectively compared data on hospital stays by corticosteroid-treated patients vs. patients not treated with corticosteroids. Nineteen patients were hospitalized. The median number of admissions per patient was 21 overall and did not differ when comparing the 10 corticosteroid-treated patients with the 9 patients not treated with corticosteroids. Four patients in the non-corticosteroid group died during a RM (mean age at death: 5.6 years). There were no deaths in the corticosteroid group. The two groups did not differ significantly in the number of RM episodes. However, for the six patients who had RM and occasionally been treated with corticosteroids, the median number of RM episodes was significantly lower when intravenous steroids had been administered. The peak plasma creatine kinase level and the area under the curve were or tended to be higher in patients treated with corticosteroids-even after the exclusion of deceased patients or focusing on the period after 2015. The median length of stay (10 days overall) was significantly longer for corticosteroid-treated patients but was similar after the exclusion of deceased patients. The absence of deaths and the higher severity of RM observed among corticosteroid-treated patients could suggest that corticotherapy is associated with greater survival.

30232275,The phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin-1 facilitates inflammation-driven colon carcinogenesis,"Abstract:Colon cancer is a devastating illness that is associated with gut inflammation. Here, we explored the possible role of lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase, in the development of colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate-treated (DSS-treated) animals deficient in lipin-1 harbored fewer tumors and carcinomas than WT animals due to decreased cellular proliferation, lower expression of antiapoptotic and protumorigenic factors, and a reduced infiltration of macrophages in colon tumors. They also displayed increased resistance to DSS-induced colitis by producing less proinflammatory cytokines and experiencing less immune infiltration. Lipin-1-deficient macrophages from the colon were less activated and displayed lower phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity than WT macrophages isolated from DSS-treated animals. Transference of WT macrophages into lipin-1-deficient animals was sufficient to increase colitis burden. Furthermore, treatment of lipin-1-deficient mice with IL-23 exacerbated colon inflammation. Analysis of human databases from colon cancer and ulcerative colitis patients showed that lipin-1 expression is increased in those disorders and correlates with the expression of the proinflammatory markers CXCL1 and CXCL2. And finally, clinically, LPIN1 expression had prognostic value in inflammatory and stem-cell subtypes of colon cancers. Collectively, these data demonstrate that lipin-1 is a critical regulator of intestinal inflammation and inflammation-driven colon cancer development.

33113595,Loss of membrane integrity drives myofiber death in lipin1-deficient skeletal muscle,"Abstract:Mutations in lipin1 are suggested to be a common cause of massive rhabdomyolysis episodes in children; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of myofiber death caused by the absence of lipin1 are not fully understood. Loss of membrane integrity is considered as an effective inducer of cell death in muscular dystrophy. In this study, we utilized a mouse line with selective homozygous lipin1 deficiency in the skeletal muscle (Lipin1Myf5cKO ) to determine the role of compromised membrane integrity in the myofiber death in lipin1-deficient muscles. We found that Lipin1Myf5cKO muscles had significantly elevated proapoptotic factors (Bax, Bak, and cleaved caspase-9) and necroptotic proteins such as RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL compared with WT mice. Moreover, Lipin1Myf5cKO muscle had significantly higher membrane disruptions, as evidenced by increased IgG staining and elevated uptake of Evans Blue Dye (EBD) and increased serum creatine kinase activity in Lipin1Myf5cKO muscle fibers. EBD-positive fibers were strongly colocalized with apoptotic or necroptotic myofibers, suggesting an association between compromised plasma membrane integrity and cell death pathways. We further show that the absence of lipin1 leads to a significant decrease in the absolute and specific muscle force (normalized to muscle mass). Our work indicates that apoptosis and necroptosis are associated with a loss of membrane integrity in Lipin1Myf5cKO muscle and that myofiber death and dysfunction may cause a decrease in contractile force.

34435332,Lipin1 Alleviates Autophagy Disorder in Sciatic Nerve and Improves Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,"Abstract:Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a chronic complication of diabetes, and its neural mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis remain unclear. Autophagy plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases and nerve tissue injury. Lipin1 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzyme that converts phosphatidic acid (PA) into diacylglycerol (DAG), a precursor of triacylglycerol and phospholipids which plays an important role in maintaining normal peripheral nerve conduction function. However, whether Lipin1 involved in the pathogenesis of DPN via regulation of autophagy is not elucidated. Here, we show that the Lipin1 expression was downregulated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DPN rat model. Interestingly, STZ prevented DAG synthesis, and resulted in autophagic hyperactivity, effects which may increase the apoptosis of Schwann cells and lead to demyelination in sciatic nerve in DPN rats. More importantly, upregulation of lipin1 in the DPN rats ameliorated autophagy disorders and pathological changes of the sciatic nerve, which associated with the increase of the motor nerve conductive velocity (MNCV) in DPN rats. In contrast, knockdown of lipin1 exacerbates neuronal abnormalities and facilitates the genesis of DPN phenotypes in rats. In addition, overexpression of lipin1 in RSC96 cells also significantly decreased the autophagic hyperactivity and apoptosis induced by hyperglycemia. These results suggest that lipin1 may exert neuroprotection within the sciatic nerve anomalies and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of DPN.

17035674,A role of lipin in human obesity and insulin resistance: relation to adipocyte glucose transport and GLUT4 expression,"Abstract:The mouse lipin gene, Lpin1, is important for adipose tissue development and is a candidate gene for insulin resistance. Here, we investigate the adipose tissue expression levels of the human LPIN1 gene in relation to various clinical variables as well as adipocyte function. LPIN1 gene expression was induced at an early step in human preadipocyte differentiation in parallel with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Lipin mRNA levels were higher in fat cells than in adipose tissue segments but showed no difference between subcutaneous and omental depots. Moreover, LPIN1 expression levels were reduced in obesity, improved following weight reduction in obese subjects, and were downregulated in women with the metabolic syndrome. With respect to adipocyte function, adipose LPIN1 gene expression was strongly associated with both basal and insulin-mediated subcutaneous adipocyte glucose transport as well as mRNA levels of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). We show that body fat accumulation is a major regulator of human adipose LPIN1 expression and suggest a role of LPIN1 in human preadipocyte as well as mature adipocyte function."
35184130,The Obesity-Related Metabolic Gene HSD17B8 Protects Against Breast Cancer: High RNA/Protein Expression Means a Better Prognosis,"Abstract:BACKGROUND The incidence of breast cancer is increasing annually. Obesity and metabolism are considered risk factors for breast cancer. Discovery of obesity- and metabolism-related breast cancer prognostic genes is imminent. MATERIAL AND METHODS We screened metabolism-related genes (MRG) from KEGG and downloaded the obese female dataset GSE151839 from GEO, which screened differentially-expressed genes (DEGs), seen as female obesity-related genes. The intersection of MRGs and DEGs was obesity-related metabolic genes (OMGs), verified by enrichment analysis. After downloading breast cancer data from TCGA, univariate Cox regression and log-rank P analyses were used to screen hub OMGs related to breast cancer prognosis. ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter, GEPIA, and GENT2 databases were used to verify the hub OMGs at the RNA level. CPTAC and HLA databases were used to verify the hub OMGs at the protein level. RESULTS We screened 33 OMGs. The results of univariate Cox regression and log-rank P analysis showed 3 of 33 OMGs (ABCA1, LPIN1, HSD17B8) were associated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients. After verification with ROC, KM-plotter, and GEPIA, only HSD17B8 was related to breast cancer prognosis (overall/disease-free survival). Results of GENT2 showed the RNA expression of HSD17B8 in breast cancer subtypes with poor prognosis is significantly lower than that with good prognosis. Results of CPTAC and HLA databases showed that the protein expression level of HSD17B8 in breast cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent normal tissues. CONCLUSIONS HSD17B8 is a protective gene against breast cancer. The higher the expression of HSD17B8, the better the prognosis of breast cancer patients."
25475986,Phosphatidate phosphatase-1 is functionally conserved in lipid synthesis and storage from human to yeast,"Abstract:Phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (PAP1) enzymes (yeast Pah1p/Smp2p, mammalian lipin1-3) have a key role in lipid homeostasis by controlling the relative proportions of its substrate phosphatidate (PA) and its product diacylglycerol (DAG). Recent investigation shows that mammalian lipin-1 complements phenotypes exhibited by yeast pah1Δ mutant cells, which indicates the functions of PAP1 enzymes are evolutionarily conserved. The observation was confirmed after transformation of human LPIN1 into PAH1-defective yeast, which resulted in human LPIN1-induced accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG )and lipid droplet formation. In double mutants lacking Tgl3p and Tgl4p, overexpression of PAH1 or LPIN1 induced TAG accumulation and excessive obesity. Furthermore, the obese yeast was used as a model to study the anti-obesity effects of PAP1 activity inhibitors, including propranolol and clenbuterol. The data showed that the inhibitors significantly suppressed TAG accumulation and lipid droplets formation. These findings demonstrate that LPIN1 plays a functional role in lipid synthesis and storage, a role which is highly conserved from human to yeast. Inhibition of TAG synthesis will become an efficacious treatment strategy for obesity and our excessive obesity model will provide a very useful tool for discovery of new anti-obesity drugs in the future.

36672909,Comprehensive Analysis of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network for Intramuscular Fat in Pigs,"Abstract:Intramuscular fat (IMF) is an essential trait closely related to meat quality. The IMF trait is a complex quantitative trait that is regulated by multiple genes. In order to better understand the process of IMF and explore the key factors affecting IMF deposition, we identified differentially expressed mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LD) between Songliao Black (SL) pigs and Landrace pigs. We obtained 606 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 55 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), and 30 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) between the SL pig and Landrace pig. Enrichment results from GO and KEGG indicate that DEGs are involved in fatty acid metabolism and some pathways related to glycogen synthesis. We constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network with 18 DELs, 11 DEMs, and 42 DEGs. Finally, the research suggests that ARID5B, CPT1B, ACSL1, LPIN1, HSP90AA1, IRS1, IRS2, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PLIN2 may be the key genes affecting IMF deposition. The LncRNAs MSTRG.19948.1, MSTRG.13120.1, MSTRG.20210.1, and MSTRG.10023.1, and the miRNAs ssc-miRNA-429 and ssc-miRNA-7-1, may play a regulatory role in IMF deposition through their respective target genes. Our research provides a reference for further understanding the regulatory mechanism of IMF.              Keywords:                    fatty acid; intramuscular fat; regulatory network."
31967386,Phosphatidic acid metabolism regulates neuroendocrine secretion but is not under the direct control of lipins,"Abstract:Phosphatidic acid (PA) produced by phospholipase D1 has been shown to contribute to secretory vesicle exocytosis in a large number of cell models. Among various hypotheses, PA may contribute to recruit and/or activate at the exocytotic site a set of proteins from the molecular machinery dedicated to secretion, but also directly influence membrane curvature thereby favoring membrane rearrangements required for membrane fusion. The release of informative molecules by regulated exocytosis is a tightly controlled process. It is thus expected that PA produced to trigger membrane fusion should be rapidly metabolized and converted in a lipid that does not present similar characteristics. PA-phosphatases of the lipin family are possible candidates as they convert PA into diacylglycerol. We show here that lipin 1 and lipin 2 are expressed in neuroendocrine cells where they are cytosolic, but also partially associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Silencing of lipin 1 or 2 did not affect significantly either basal or evoked secretion from PC12 cells, suggesting that it is unlikely that conversion of PA into a secondary lipid by lipins might represent a regulatory step in exocytosis in neurosecretory cells. However, in agreement with a model in which PA-metabolism could contribute to prevent entering into exocytosis of additional secretory vesicles, ectopic expression of lipin1B-GFP in bovine chromaffin cells reduced the number of exocytotic events as revealed by carbon fiber amperometry recording. Furthermore, individual spike parameters reflecting fusion pore dynamics were also modified by lipin1B-GFP, suggesting that a tight control of PA levels represents an important regulatory step of the number and kinetic of exocytotic events.

31240148,Long-term outcomes in a 25-year-old female affected with lipin-1 deficiency,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.4) that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and inorganic phosphate. Deficiency of this enzyme causes potentially fatal severe, recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis triggered by infection. The defect has only recently been recognized so little is known about the long-term outcome in adult patients with this disorder. We report the course and outcome of a 25-year-old female patient with lipin-1 deficiency after a recent episode of rhabdomyolysis requiring intensive care admission with a peak creatine kinase of 500 000 IU/L. One-year post discharge from intensive care, the patient has residual drop foot bilaterally consistent with bilateral common peroneal neuropathies in addition to a background residual distal myopathy.

36147301,"The hypolipidemic mechanism of chrysanthemum flavonoids and its main components, luteolin and luteoloside, based on the gene expression profile","Abstract:In this study, the following four groups of mice with hyperlipidemia were involved: the model control group (MC), the Chrysanthemum flavonoids group (CF), the luteolin group, and the luteoloside group. The whole gene expression profile was detected in the liver tissues of each group. Differential genes significantly enriched in the biological process of gene ontology (GO) items and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were selected, and 4 differential genes related to lipid metabolism were selected for further real-time quantitative PCR verification. Compared with the MC, 41 differential genes such as Sqle, Gck, and Idi1 were screened in the CF intervention group; 68 differential genes such as Acsl3, Cyp7a1, and Lpin1 were screened in the luteolin intervention group (CF); and 51 differential genes such as Acaca, Cyp7a1, and Lpin1 were screened in the luteoloside group. The mechanism of CF to improve hyperlipidemia is very complex, mainly involving biological processes such as cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis, luteolin mainly involves the synthesis and transport of cholesterol, and luteoloside mainly involves fatty acid metabolism. The functional pathways of CF may not be completely the same as luteolin and luteoloside, and further study is needed on the mechanism of action of other components.

36932214,DIAPH1 mediates progression of atherosclerosis and regulates hepatic lipid metabolism in mice,"Abstract:Atherosclerosis evolves through dysregulated lipid metabolism interwoven with exaggerated inflammation. Previous work implicating the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in atherosclerosis prompted us to explore if Diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1), which binds to the RAGE cytoplasmic domain and is important for RAGE signaling, contributes to these processes. We intercrossed atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr-/- mice with mice devoid of Diaph1 and fed them Western diet for 16 weeks. Compared to male Ldlr-/- mice, male Ldlr-/- Diaph1-/- mice displayed significantly less atherosclerosis, in parallel with lower plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides. Female Ldlr-/- Diaph1-/- mice displayed significantly less atherosclerosis compared to Ldlr-/- mice and demonstrated lower plasma concentrations of cholesterol, but not plasma triglycerides. Deletion of Diaph1 attenuated expression of genes regulating hepatic lipid metabolism, Acaca, Acacb, Gpat2, Lpin1, Lpin2 and Fasn, without effect on mRNA expression of upstream transcription factors Srebf1, Srebf2 or Mxlipl in male mice. We traced DIAPH1-dependent mechanisms to nuclear translocation of SREBP1 in a manner independent of carbohydrate- or insulin-regulated cues but, at least in part, through the actin cytoskeleton. This work unveils new regulators of atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism through DIAPH1."
33277966,Prognostic value of lipid metabolism-related genes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Abstract                        Background:                    Altered lipid metabolism is involved in the development of many tumors. However, the role of dissimilar lipid metabolism in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not fully established.              Aims:                    Here, we sought to determine the prognostic value of lipid metabolism-related genes in HNSCC.              Methods:                    RNA-seq data and clinical features of 545 HNSCC cases were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A regulatory network of transcription factors-lipid metabolism genes and a risk prognostic model of lipid metabolism-related genes was developed using bioinformatics and Cox regression modeling. We used tumor immune estimation resource to analyze immune cell infiltration in patients with HNSCC based on the prognostic index (PI) of lipid metabolism-related genes.              Results:                    A total of 136 differentially expressed lipid metabolism genes were identified. Of these, 23 are related to prognosis. In addition to predicting HNSCC prognosis, 11 lipid metabolism-related genes (ARSI, CYP27B1, CYP2D6, DGKG, DHCR7, LPIN1, PHYH, PIP5K1B, PLA2G2D, RDH16, and TRIB3) also affect HNSCC clinical features (stage, gender, and pathological stage).

24930972,Lipin-1 regulates autophagy clearance and intersects with statin drug effects in skeletal muscle,"Abstract:LPIN1 encodes lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol. Homozygous LPIN1 gene mutations cause severe rhabdomyolysis, and heterozygous LPIN1 missense mutations may promote statin-induced myopathy. We demonstrate that lipin-1-related myopathy in the mouse is associated with a blockade in autophagic flux and accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Lipin-1 PAP activity is required for maturation of autolysosomes, through its activation of the protein kinase D (PKD)-Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling cascade. Statin treatment also reduces PKD activation and autophagic flux, which are compounded by diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) abundance in lipin-1-haploinsufficent and -deficient muscle. Lipin-1 restoration in skeletal muscle prevents myonecrosis and statin toxicity in vivo, and activated PKD rescues autophagic flux in lipin-1-deficient cells. Our findings identify lipin-1 PAP activity as a component of the macroautophagy pathway and define the basis for lipin-1-related myopathies."
29765047,Tip60-mediated lipin 1 acetylation and ER translocation determine triacylglycerol synthesis rate,"Abstract:Obesity is characterized by excessive fatty acid conversion to triacylglycerols (TAGs) in adipose tissues. However, how signaling networks sense fatty acids and connect to the stimulation of lipid synthesis remains elusive. Here, we show that homozygous knock-in mice carrying a point mutation at the Ser86 phosphorylation site of acetyltransferase Tip60 (Tip60 SA/SA ) display remarkably reduced body fat mass, and Tip60 SA/SA females fail to nurture pups to adulthood due to severely reduced milk TAGs. Mechanistically, fatty acids stimulate Tip60-dependent acetylation and endoplasmic reticulum translocation of phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin 1 to generate diacylglycerol for TAG synthesis, which is repressed by deacetylase Sirt1. Inhibition of Tip60 activity strongly blocks fatty acid-induced TAG synthesis while Sirt1 suppression leads to increased adiposity. Genetic analysis of loss-of-function mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals a requirement of ESA1, yeast ortholog of Tip60, in TAG accumulation. These findings uncover a conserved mechanism linking fatty acid sensing to fat synthesis."
26288136,Lipin-1 contributes to modified low-density lipoprotein-elicited macrophage pro-inflammatory responses,"Abstract:Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of large and medium-sized arteries and the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, a major cause of mortality worldwide. The over-accumulation of modified cholesterol-containing low-density lipoproteins (e.g. oxLDL) in the artery wall and the subsequent recruitment and activation of macrophages contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. The excessive uptake of modified-LDL by macrophages leads to a lipid-laden ""foamy"" phenotype and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Modified-LDLs promote foam cell formation in part by stimulating de novo lipid biosynthesis. However, it is unknown if lipid biosynthesis directly regulates foam cell pro-inflammatory mediator production. Lipin-1, a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase required for the generation of diacylglycerol during glycerolipid synthesis has recently been demonstrated to contribute to bacterial-induced pro-inflammatory responses by macrophages. In this study we present evidence demonstrating the presence of lipin-1 within macrophages in human atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, reducing lipin-1 levels in macrophages significantly inhibits both modified-LDL-induced foam cell formation in vitro, as observed by smaller/fewer intracellular lipid inclusions, and ablates modified-LDL-elicited production of the pro-atherogenic mediators tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and prostaglandin E2. These findings demonstrate a critical role for lipin-1 in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory responses to modified-LDL. These data begin to link the processes of foam cell formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production within macrophages.

31265202,Dihydroartemisinin attenuates alcoholic fatty liver through regulation of lipin-1 signaling,"Abstract:Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is generated from excessive alcohol consumption, characterized by hepatic steatosis. Mechanistically, excessive hepatic lipid accumulation was attributed to the aberrant lipin-1 signaling during the development of alcoholic steatosis in rodent species and human. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has been recently identified to relieve hepatocytes necrosis and prevent from hepatic steatosis in alcohol-induced liver diseases; however, the role of DHA in ALD has not been elucidated completely. Therefore, this study was aimed to further identify the potential mechanisms of pharmacological effects of DHA on ALD. Results demonstrated that DHA regulated the expression and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of lipin-1 in mice with chronic ethanol exposure. Results confirmed that the disruption of lipin-1 signaling abolished the suppression of DHA on alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis. Interestingly, DHA also significantly improved liver injury, and inflammation mediated by lipin-1 signaling in chronic alcohol-fed mice. in vivo experiments further consolidated the concept that DHA protected against hepatocyte lipoapoptosis dependent on the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of lipin-1 signaling, resulting in attenuated ratio of Lpin1 β/α. Obvious increases in cell apoptosis were observed in alcohol-treated lipin1β-overexpressed mice. Although DHA attenuated cell apoptosis, overexpression of lipin-1β neutralized DHA action. DHA ameliorated activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress through inhibiting activation of JNK and CHOP, which was abrogated by overexpression of lipin-1β. In summary, DHA significantly improved liver injury, steatosis and hepatocyte lipoapoptosis in chronic alcohol-fed mice via regulation of lipin-1 signaling.

33198224,Fructose Consumption Affects Glucocorticoid Signaling in the Liver of Young Female Rats,"Abstract:The effects of early-life fructose consumption on hepatic signaling pathways and their relation to the development of metabolic disorders in later life are not fully understood. To investigate whether fructose overconsumption at a young age induces alterations in glucocorticoid signaling that might contribute to development of metabolic disturbances, we analysed glucocorticoid receptor hormone-binding parameters and expression of its target genes involved in gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase) and lipid metabolism (lipin-1), as well as redox and inflammatory status in the liver of female rats subjected to a fructose-rich diet immediately after weaning. The fructose diet increased hepatic corticosterone concentration, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 level, glucocorticoid receptor protein level and hormone-binding activity, as well as lipin-1 level. The expression of glucose-6-phosphatase was reduced in fructose-fed rats, while phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase remained unaltered. The fructose-rich diet increased the level of fructose transporter GLUT2, while the expression of fructolytic enzymes fructokinase and aldolase B remained unaltered. The diet also affected pro-inflammatory pathways, but had no effect on the antioxidant defence system. In conclusion, a fructose-rich diet applied immediately after weaning promoted lipogenesis and enhanced hepatic glucocorticoid signaling, possibly to protect against inflammatory damage, but without an effect on gluconeogenesis and antioxidant enzymes. Yet, prolonged treatment might ultimately lead to more pronounced metabolic disturbances.

31752156,Differential Roles of Lipin1 and Lipin2 in the Hepatitis C Virus Replication Cycle,"Abstract:Although their origin, nature and structure are not identical, a common feature of positive-strand RNA viruses is their ability to subvert host lipids and intracellular membranes to generate replication and assembly complexes. Recently, lipin1, a cellular enzyme that converts phosphatidic acid into diacylglycerol, has been implicated in the formation of the membranous web that hosts hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicase. In the liver, lipin1 cooperates with lipin2 to maintain glycerolipid homeostasis. We extended our previous study of the lipin family on HCV infection, by determining the impact of the lipin2 silencing on viral replication. Our data reveal that lipin2 silencing interferes with HCV virion secretion at late stages of the infection, without significantly affecting viral replication or assembly. Moreover, uninfected lipin2-, but not lipin1-deficient cells display alterations in mitochondrial and Golgi apparatus morphology, suggesting that lipin2 contributes to the maintenance of the overall organelle architecture. Finally, our data suggest a broader function of lipin2 for replication of HCV and other RNA viruses, in contrast with the specific impact of lipin1 silencing on HCV replication. Overall, this study reveals distinctive functions of lipin1 and lipin2 in cells of hepatic origin, a context in which they are often considered functionally redundant.

34576941,NLIP and HAD-like Domains of Pah1 and Lipin 1 Phosphatidate Phosphatases Are Essential for Their Catalytic Activities,"Abstract              Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pah1 phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidate to yield diacylglycerol, controlling phospholipids and triacylglycerol metabolisms. Pah1 and human Lipin 1 are intrinsically disordered proteins with 56% and 43% unfolded regions, respectively. Truncation analysis of the conserved and non-conserved regions showed that N- and C-conserved regions are essential for the catalytic activity of Pah1. PAP activities can be detected in the conserved N-terminal Lipin (NLIP) domain and C-terminal Lipin (CLIP)/haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like domain of Pah1 and Lipin 1, suggesting that the evolutionarily conserved domains are essential for the catalytic activity. The removal of disordered hydrophilic regions drastically reduced the protein solubility of Pah1. Thioredoxin is an efficient fusion protein for production of soluble NLIP-HAD recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli.

26946540,CDP-diacylglycerol synthases regulate the growth of lipid droplets and adipocyte development,"Abstract:The expansion of lipid droplets (LDs) and the differentiation of preadipocytes are two important aspects of mammalian lipid storage. In this study, we examined the role of CDP-diacylglycerol (DAG) synthases (CDSs), encoded by CDS1 and CDS2 genes in mammals, in lipid storage. CDS enzymes catalyze the formation of CDP-DAG from phosphatidic acid (PA). Knocking down either CDS1 or CDS2 resulted in the formation of giant or supersized LDs in cultured cells. Moreover, depleting CDS1 almost completely blocked the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas depleting CDS2 had a moderate inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation. The levels of many PA species were significantly increased upon knocking down CDS1 In contrast, only a small number of PA species were increased upon depleting CDS2 Importantly, the amount of PA in the endoplasmic reticulum was dramatically increased upon knocking down CDS1 or CDS2 Our results suggest that the changes in PA level and localization may underlie the formation of giant LDs as well as the block in adipogenesis in CDS-deficient cells. We have therefore identified CDS1 and CDS2 as important novel regulators of lipid storage, and these results highlight the crucial role of phospholipids in mammalian lipid storage.

The mutation of WDR35 may lead to short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRP), asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD, Jeune syndrome) and Ellis van Creveld syndrome. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of WDR35 in fetal anomaly.              Results:                    The fetuses presented malformation with abnormal head shape, cardiac dilatation, pericardial effusion, and non-displayed left pulmonary artery and left lung. After the detection of genomic DNA (gDNA) in amniotic fluid cells (AFC), chromosomal rearrangement was found in arr[hg19] 2p25.3p23.3. It was revealed through multiple PCR-DHPLC that MYCN, WDR35, LPIN1, ODC1, KLF11 and NBAS contained duplicated copy numbers in 2p25.3p23.3. AF-MSCs were mostly positive for CD44, CD105, negative for CD34 and CD14. Western Blot test showed that WDR35-encoded protein was decreased in the patients' AFC compared to that in normal pregnant women. In the patients' amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs), WDR35 overexpression could repair cilia formation, and the overexpression of WDR35 or Gli2 could significantly enhance ALP activity and expressions of osteogenic differentiation marker genes, including RUNXE2, OCN, BSP and ALP. However, WDR35 silencing in C3H10T1/2 cells could remarkably inhibit cilia formation and osteogenic differentiation. This inhibitory effect could be attenuated by Gli2 overexpression.              Conclusions:                    The results demonstrated that copy number variation (CNV) of WDR35 may lead to skeletal dysplasia and fetal anomaly, and that down-regulated WDR35 may damage the cilia formation and sequentially indirectly regulate Gli signal, which would eventually result in negative regulation of osteogenic differentiation.

25252959,Lipin-1 integrates lipid synthesis with proinflammatory responses during TLR activation in macrophages,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase involved in the de novo synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides. Using macrophages from lipin-1-deficient animals and human macrophages deficient in the enzyme, we show in this work that this phosphatase acts as a proinflammatory mediator during TLR signaling and during the development of in vivo inflammatory processes. After TLR4 stimulation lipin-1-deficient macrophages showed a decreased production of diacylglycerol and activation of MAPKs and AP-1. Consequently, the generation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, or enzymes like inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, was reduced. In addition, animals lacking lipin-1 had a faster recovery from endotoxin administration concomitant with a reduced production of harmful molecules in spleen and liver. These findings demonstrate an unanticipated role for lipin-1 as a mediator of macrophage proinflammatory activation and support a critical link between lipid biosynthesis and systemic inflammatory responses."
25117580,TORC1 regulates Pah1 phosphatidate phosphatase activity via the Nem1/Spo7 protein phosphatase complex,"Abstract:The evolutionarily conserved target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) controls growth-related processes such as protein, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism in response to growth hormones, energy/ATP levels, and amino acids. Its deregulation is associated with cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Among other substrates, mammalian TORC1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits the phosphatidate phosphatase lipin-1, a central enzyme in lipid metabolism that provides diacylglycerol for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids and/or triacylglycerol as neutral lipid reserve. Here, we show that yeast TORC1 inhibits the function of the respective lipin, Pah1, to prevent the accumulation of triacylglycerol. Surprisingly, TORC1 regulates Pah1 in part indirectly by controlling the phosphorylation status of Nem1 within the Pah1-activating, heterodimeric Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase module. Our results delineate a hitherto unknown TORC1 effector branch that controls lipin function in yeast, which, given the recent discovery of Nem1-Spo7 orthologous proteins in humans, may be conserved."
25797648,miR-217 regulates ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation by disrupting sirtuin 1-lipin-1 signaling,"Abstract:Ethanol-mediated injury, combined with gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), provokes generation of proinflammatory cytokines in Kupffer cells, causing hepatic inflammation. Among the mediators of these effects, miR-217 aggravates ethanol-induced steatosis in hepatocytes. However, the role of miR-217 in ethanol-induced liver inflammation process is unknown. Here, we examined the role of miR-217 in the responses to ethanol, LPS, or a combination of ethanol and LPS in RAW 264.7 macrophages and in primary Kupffer cells. In macrophages, ethanol substantially exacerbated LPS-mediated induction of miR-217 and production of proinflammatory cytokines compared with LPS or ethanol alone. Consistently, ethanol administration to mice led to increases in miR-217 abundance and increased production of inflammatory cytokines in isolated primary Kupffer cells exposed to the combination of ethanol and LPS. miR-217 promoted combined ethanol and LPS-mediated inhibition of sirtuin 1 expression and activity in macrophages. Moreover, miR-217-mediated sirtuin 1 inhibition was accompanied by increased activities of two vital inflammatory regulators, NF-κB and the nuclear factor of activated T cells c4. Finally, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-217 led to steatosis and inflammation in mice. These findings suggest that miR-217 is a pivotal regulator involved in ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation. Strategies to inhibit hepatic miR-217 could be a viable approach in attenuating alcoholic hepatitis."
32648926,MAPK-interacting kinase 2 (MNK2) regulates adipocyte metabolism independently of its catalytic activity,"Abstract:The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinases (MNKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by the ERK1/2 (extracellular regulated kinase) and p38α/β MAPK pathways. The MNKs have previously been implicated in metabolic disease and shown to mediate diet-induced obesity. In particular, knockout of MNK2 in mice protects from the weight gain induced by a high-fat diet. These and other data suggest that MNK2 regulates the expansion of adipose tissue (AT), a stable, long-term energy reserve that plays an important role in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis. Using the well-established mouse 3T3-L1 in vitro model of adipogenesis, the role of the MNKs in adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage was investigated. Inhibition of MNK activity using specific inhibitors failed to impair adipogenesis or lipid accumulation, suggesting that MNK activity is not required for adipocyte differentiation and does not regulate lipid storage. However, small-interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of MNK2 did reduce lipid accumulation and regulated the levels of two major lipogenic transcriptional regulators, ChREBP (carbohydrate response element-binding protein) and LPIN1 (Lipin-1). These factors are responsible for controlling the expression of genes for proteins involved in de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis. The knock-down of MNK2 also increased the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase which catalyses the breakdown of triglyceride. These findings identify MNK2 as a regulator of adipocyte metabolism, independently of its catalytic activity, and reveal some of the mechanisms by which MNK2 drives AT expansion. The development of an MNK2-targeted therapy may, therefore, be a useful intervention for reducing weight caused by excessive nutrient intake.

34719943,Short-term physical inactivity induces diacylglycerol accumulation and insulin resistance in muscle via lipin1 activation,"Abstract:Physical inactivity impairs muscle insulin sensitivity. However, its mechanism is unclear. To model physical inactivity, we applied 24-h hind-limb cast immobilization (HCI) to mice with normal or high-fat diet (HFD) and evaluated intramyocellular lipids and the insulin signaling pathway in the soleus muscle. Although 2-wk HFD alone did not alter intramyocellular diacylglycerol (IMDG) accumulation, HCI alone increased it by 1.9-fold and HCI after HFD further increased it by 3.3-fold. Parallel to this, we found increased protein kinase C ε (PKCε) activity, reduced insulin-induced 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake, and reduced phosphorylation of insulin receptor β (IRβ) and Akt, key molecules for insulin signaling pathway. Lipin1, which converts phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, showed increase of its activity by HCI, and dominant-negative lipin1 expression in muscle prevented HCI-induced IMDG accumulation and impaired insulin-induced 2-DOG uptake. Furthermore, 24-h leg cast immobilization in human increased lipin1 expression. Thus, even short-term immobilization increases IMDG and impairs insulin sensitivity in muscle via enhanced lipin1 activity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Physical inactivity impairs muscle insulin sensitivity.

24145088,Metabolic effects of the HIV protease inhibitor--saquinavir in differentiating human preadipocytes,"Abstract                        Background:                    The iatrogenic, HIV-related lipodystrophy is associated with development of the significant metabolic and cardiovascular complications. The underlying mechanisms of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are not completely explored.              Methods:                    The aim of the study was to characterize effects of the protease inhibitor (PI)--saquinavir (SQV) on metabolic functions, and gene expression during differentiation in cells (Chub-S7) culture.              Results:                    SQV in concentrations observed during antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), oxygen consumption and ATP generation. The effects were greater in already differentiated cells. This was accompanied by characteristic changes in the expression of the genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and differentiation (lipid droplet formation) process such as: WNT10a, C/EBPa, AFT4, CIDEC, ADIPOQ, LPIN1.              Conclusions:                    The results indicate that SQV affects not only metabolic (mitochondrial) activity of adipocytes, but affects the expression of genes related to differentiation and to a lesser extent to cell apoptosis."
31757765,RNA-Seq analysis of the pathogenesis of STZ-induced male diabetic mouse liver,"Abstract                        Objective:                    Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The liver is a key organ involved in glucose metabolism, and the major target proteins' changes in the pathogenesis are still unknown.              Methods:                    A diabetic mouse model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) solution and the RNA-Seq analysis was used to evaluate the transcription differences in the livers of diabetic mice of this study. And then, the differentially expressed genes were validated between a normal mouse group (n = 6) and a diabetic mouse group (n = 6) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis. In addition, we also constructed protein-protein interacting (PPI) networks of up-regulated and down-regulated genes.              Results:                    Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed 370 up-regulated differentially expressed genes and 281 down-regulated differentially expressed genes in the diabetes model. The gene ontology (GO) analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis results showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in immunity, enzyme activity, metabolism, and steroid synthesis. PPI analysis results indicated that the main 15 core differential proteins (Cyp51a1, Acsl4, Ugt1a1, Stat1, Gsta2, Cbr1, Aldh1a1, Fasn, Ces1, Camk2b, Tap1, Egr1, Sqle, Lpin1, Fabp5) were involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. The qRT-PCR results showed that expression changes of four genes (Acsl4, Stat1, Gsta2, Fabp5) were in different directions from those of RNA-Seq. Western blotting results indicated that Sqle expression change at the protein level was in opposition direction from qRT-PCR, and we speculated that Sqle may be involved in the post-transcriptional modification process.              Conclusions:                    Our data speculated that the pathogenesis of diabetes may be mediated mainly through steroid biosynthesis, metabolic processes, and immune responses. Further researches on these pathways may provide new targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.

32927110,Proteomic analysis of liver in diet-induced Hyperlipidemic mice under Fructus Rosa roxburghii action,"Abstract:Fructus Rosae Roxburghii (FRR) has been considered as edible and medicinal fruit possessing antiatherosclerotic effect, but the mechanism is still unclear. HLP is material basis for AS formation. Under FRR action, TC, TG, LDL, HDL and ASI in serum were regulated to control level. Differentially expressed proteins in liver were analyzed by using TMT labeling and LC-MS/MS for better understanding the effect and molecular mechanism of FRR on diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice. In total, 4460 proteins were quantified, of which 469 proteins showed dramatic changes between each group. According to molecular functions, 25 differentially co-expressed proteins were divided into five categories: substance metabolism, energy transformation and signal transduction, transcription and translation, immune defense. 15 key proteins involved lipids metabolism, which were identified as Cyp7a1, Cyp3a11, Tm7sf2, COAT2, CSAD, RBP3, Lpin1, Dhrs4, Aldh1b1, GK, Acot 4, TSC22D1, PGFS, EHs, GSTM1. This suggested that FRR could maintain metabolic homeostasis by regulating the metabolism of fatty acids, biosynthesis of BAs and steroids, and production of LPOs. 20 oxidative lipids further confirmed their importance regulating lipids metabolism. It's first time potential antiatherosclerotic mechanism of FRR regulating blood lipids was explored from protein level, which is of great significance to explore new drug targets for AS. SIGNIFICANCE: Under the action of FRR juice, the blood lipids in mice were regulated to control level. By TMT proteomic analysis, the effect and molecular mechanism of FRR on diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice were further explored. 25 differentially co-expressed proteins obtained in three diet groups might cooperatively regulate the lipids metabolism and hepatic function of mice, thus maintaining the metabolism homeostasis. By lipidomics analysis, 20 oxidative lipids further confirmed the importance of ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs in regulating the lipids metabolism. These findings provide an improved understanding for the regulation of FRR on the blood lipids and explores potential metabolic targets for AS prevention.

36715084,Lipin1 plays complementary roles in myofibre stability and regeneration in dystrophic muscles,"Abstract:Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle wasting disorder caused by dystrophin mutations, leading to the loss of sarcolemmal integrity, and resulting in progressive myofibre necrosis and impaired muscle function. Our previous studies suggest that lipin1 is important for skeletal muscle regeneration and myofibre integrity. Additionally, we discovered that mRNA expression levels of lipin1 were significantly reduced in skeletal muscle of DMD patients and the mdx mouse model. To understand the role of lipin1 in dystrophic muscle, we generated dystrophin/lipin1 double knockout (DKO) mice, and compared the limb muscle pathology and function of wild-type B10, muscle-specific lipin1 deficient (lipin1Myf5cKO ), mdx and DKO mice. We found that further knockout of lipin1 in dystrophic muscle exhibited a more severe phenotype characterized by increased necroptosis, fibrosis and exacerbated membrane damage in DKO compared to mdx mice. In barium chloride-induced muscle injury, both lipin1Myf5cKO and DKO showed prolonged regeneration at day 14 post-injection, suggesting that lipin1 is critical for muscle regeneration. In situ contractile function assays showed that lipin1 deficiency in dystrophic muscle led to reduced specific force production. Using a cell culture system, we found that lipin1 deficiency led to elevated expression levels of necroptotic markers and medium creatine kinase, which could be a result of sarcolemmal damage. Most importantly, restoration of lipin1 inhibited the elevation of necroptotic markers in differentiated primary lipin1-deficient myoblasts. Overall, our data suggests that lipin1 plays complementary roles in myofibre stability and muscle function in dystrophic muscles, and overexpression of lipin1 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for dystrophic muscles. KEY POINTS: We identified that lipin1 mRNA expression levels are significantly reduced in skeletal muscles of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and mdx mice. We found that further depletion of lipin1 in skeletal muscles of mdx mice induces more severe dystrophic phenotypes, including enhanced myofibre sarcolemma damage, muscle necroptosis, inflammation, fibrosis and reduced specific force production. Lipin1 deficiency leads to elevated expression levels of necroptotic markers, whereas restoration of lipin1 inhibits their expression. Our results suggest that lipin1 is functionally complementary to dystrophin in muscle membrane integrity and muscle regeneration.

31492716,Fat oxidation is impaired during exercise in lipin-1 deficiency,"Abstract                        Objective:                    To investigate substrate metabolism during exercise in an adult with lipin-1 deficiency, an inherited defect in lipid homeostasis, and to study the effect of glucose supplementation on his exercise tolerance.              Methods:                    We studied a 48-year-old man with lipin-1 deficiency and 2 healthy men. The patient has exercise intolerance and monthly episodes of rhabdomyolysis. All participants performed a submaximal exercise test while total fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and palmitate oxidation rate were assessed by stable isotope technique and indirect calorimetry. On another day, the patient was infused with 10% glucose (410 mL/h) and repeated the exercise. On the third and fourth visits, he was randomized in a double-blind manner to drink a supplement of glucose (soft drink 2% concentration) or placebo (soft drink: aspartame, acesulfame-K) before and during exercise.              Results:                    Mean FAO and palmitate oxidation rate during exercise were lower in the patient vs controls: 431 vs 1,271 and 1912 μmol/min and 122 vs 191 and 212 μmol/min. Plasma fatty acid concentration was lower in the patient during exercise than in controls: 477 vs 643 and 630 μmol/L. The patient's exercise duration increased from 36 to 60 minutes with IV glucose and 46 minutes with oral glucose, and his rating of exertion dropped from 15 to 9 on average (Borg scale).              Conclusion:                    In this adult lipin-1-deficient patient, FAO was reduced, which was associated with no increase in plasma free fatty acids during submaximal exercise, and his exercise capacity improved with continuous ingestion of high-dose glucose.

27344312,Redundant roles of the phosphatidate phosphatase family in triacylglycerol synthesis in human adipocytes,"Abstract                        Aims/hypothesis:                    In mammals, the evolutionary conserved family of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases (PAP1), involved in phospholipid and triacylglycerol synthesis, consists of lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3. While mutations in the murine Lpin1 gene cause lipodystrophy and its knockdown in mouse 3T3-L1 cells impairs adipogenesis, deleterious mutations of human LPIN1 do not affect adipose tissue distribution. However, reduced LPIN1 and PAP1 activity has been described in participants with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to characterise the roles of all lipin family members in human adipose tissue and adipogenesis.              Methods:                    The expression of the lipin family was analysed in adipose tissue in a cross-sectional study. Moreover, the effects of lipin small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion on in vitro human adipogenesis were assessed.              Results:                    Adipose tissue gene expression of the lipin family is altered in type 2 diabetes. Depletion of every lipin family member in a human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell line, alters expression levels of adipogenic transcription factors and lipid biosynthesis genes in early stages of differentiation. Lipin-1 knockdown alone causes a 95% depletion of PAP1 activity. Despite the reduced PAP1 activity and alterations in early adipogenesis, lipin-silenced cells differentiate and accumulate neutral lipids. Even combinatorial knockdown of lipins shows mild effects on triacylglycerol accumulation in mature adipocytes.              Conclusions/interpretation:                    Overall, our data support the hypothesis of alternative pathways for triacylglycerol synthesis in human adipocytes under conditions of repressed lipin expression. We propose that induction of alternative lipid phosphate phosphatases, along with the inhibition of lipid hydrolysis, contributes to the maintenance of triacylglycerol content to near normal levels.

34959999,Raphani Semen ( Raphanus sativus L.) Ameliorates Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease by Regulating De Novo Lipogenesis,"Abstract:In this study, we investigated the pharmacological effect of a water extract of Raphani Semen (RSWE) on alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) using ethanol-induced AFLD mice (the NIAAA model) and palmitic acid (PA)-induced steatosis HepG2 cells. An RSWE supplement improved serum and hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels of AFLD mice, as well as their liver histological structure. To explore the molecular action of RSWE in the improvement of AFLD, we investigated the effect of RSWE on four major pathways for lipid homeostasis in the liver: free fatty acid transport, lipogenesis, lipolysis, and β-oxidation. Importantly, RSWE decreased the mRNA expression of de novo lipogenesis-related genes, such as Srebf1, Cebpa, Pparg, and Lpin1, as well as the protein levels of these factors, in the liver of AFLD mice. That these actions of RSWE affect lipogenesis was confirmed using PA-induced steatosis HepG2 cells. Overall, our findings suggest that RSWE has the potential for improvement of AFLD by inhibiting de novo lipogenesis.

21448847,Lipin 1 gene polymorphisms in polycystic ovary syndrome,"Abstract:Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder associated with increased prevalence of insulin resistance (IR). IR could be implicated in PCOS etiology and represents the major cause of cardiometabolic complications. The aim of present study was to investigate for the first time the association of lipin 1 gene polymorphisms with metabolic and hormonal profile in PCOS patients and controls. Into a case-control study 371 individuals were enrolled: 222 PCOS patients and 149 controls. Two lipin 1 gene polymorphisms were analyzed: rs11693809 (intron 1 SNP) and rs2716610 (intron 17 SNP) using fluorescent hydrolyzing probes. Body mass index, fasting plasma insulin and glucose along with androgen profile were measured in all subjects. Plasma lipids were measured in 93 patients and 43 controls and oral glucose test (OGTT) was performed on 68 PCOS patients. C/T heterozygotes for intron 1 SNP had significantly lower LDL-cholesterol than wild type C/C homozygotes (p=0.026) in the control group. In PCOS patients, mutated T/T homozygotes exhibited significantly lower glucose after OGTT than heterozygotes (p=0.033). Similarly, in nonobese PCOS patients, intron 1 SNP T/T homozygotes had lower HOMA-IR than heterozygotes (p=0.009). For intron 17 SNP, mutated C/T+T/T genotypes were associated with higher plasma triglycerides in controls (p=0.039). Genotype and allele frequencies were similar between PCOS patients and controls for both SNPs. Our results show that, in PCOS patients, intron 1 SNP is protective against IR and glucose intolerance suggesting that lipin 1 variation could be one of the genetic factors in cardiometabolic complications of PCOS."
32475074,Caenorhabditis elegans Lipin 1 moderates the lifespan-shortening effects of dietary glucose by maintaining ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids,"Abstract:Excessive glucose causes various diseases and decreases lifespan by altering metabolic processes, but underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that Lipin 1/LPIN-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase and a putative transcriptional coregulator, prevents life-shortening effects of dietary glucose on Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that depletion of lpin-1 decreased overall lipid levels, despite increasing the expression of genes that promote fat synthesis and desaturation, and downregulation of lipolysis. We then showed that knockdown of lpin-1 altered the composition of various fatty acids in the opposite direction of dietary glucose. In particular, the levels of two ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, were increased by knockdown of lpin-1 but decreased by glucose feeding. Importantly, these ω-6 PUFAs attenuated the short lifespan of glucose-fed lpin-1-inhibited animals. Thus, the production of ω-6 PUFAs is crucial for protecting animals from living very short under glucose-rich conditions.

36980830,Effect of Dietetic Obesity on Testicular Transcriptome in Cynomolgus Monkeys,"Abstract:Obesity is a metabolic disorder resulting from behavioral, environmental and heritable causes, and can have a negative impact on male reproduction. There have been few experiments in mice, rats, and rabbits on the effects of obesity on reproduction, which has inhibited the development of better treatments for male subfertility caused by obesity. Nonhuman primates are most similar to human beings in anatomy, physiology, metabolism, and biochemistry and are appropriate subjects for obesity studies. In this investigation, we conducted a transcriptome analysis of the testes of cynomolgus monkeys on high-fat, high-fructose, and cholesterol-rich diets to determine the effect of obesity on gene expression in testes. The results showed that the testes of obese monkeys had abnormal morphology, and their testes transcriptome was significantly different from that of non-obese animals. We identified 507 differentially abundant genes (adjusted p value < 0.01, log2 [FC] > 2) including 163 up-regulated and 344 down-regulated genes. Among the differentially abundant genes were ten regulatory genes, including IRF1, IRF6, HERC5, HERC6, IFIH1, IFIT2, IFIT5, IFI35, RSAD2, and UBQLNL. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis was conducted, and we found that processes and pathways associated with the blood testes barrier (BTB), immunity, inflammation, and DNA methylation in gametes were preferentially enriched. We also found abnormal expression of genes related to infertility (TDRD5, CLCN2, MORC1, RFX8, SOHLH1, IL2RB, MCIDAS, ZPBP, NFIA, PTPN11, TSC22D3, MAPK6, PLCB1, DCUN1D1, LPIN1, and GATM) and down-regulation of testosterone in monkeys with dietetic obesity. This work not only provides an important reference for research and treatment on male infertility caused by obesity, but also valuable insights into the effects of diet on gene expression in testes.

35246007,Quantitative proteomics analysis based on tandem mass tag labeling coupled with labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry discovers the effect of silibinin on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice,"Abstract:In recent years, the beneficial effects of silibinin (SIL) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have attracted widespread attention. We tried to study the intervention effect of SIL on NAFLD, and explore the potential mechanisms and targets of SIL on NAFLD improvement. Thirty-three male C57BL6/J mice were divided into three groups, and, respectively, fed a normal diet (ND), a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD given SIL treatment (HFD+SIL). Biochemical indexes and histopathological changes of mice in each group were detected. In addition, quantitative proteomics analysis based on tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and bioinformatics analysis was performed on protein changes in the livers. SIL could reduce the weight of mice, reduce liver lipid deposition, and improve glucose metabolism. Through comparison among the three experimental groups, a total of 30 overlapping proteins were found. These identified proteins were closely linked to liver lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Moreover, some drug targets were found, namely perilipin-2, phosphatidate phosphatase LPIN1, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and glutathione S-transferase A1. In conclusions, high-fat diet increases the expressions of proteins implicated in lipid synthesis and transport in the liver, which can result in disorders of liver lipid metabolism.

35096633,"Porphyromonas gingivalis Administration Induces Gestational Obesity, Alters Gene Expression in the Liver and Brown Adipose Tissue in Pregnant Mice, and Causes Underweight in Fetuses","Abstract:Preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes is crucial for maternal and child health. Periodontal disease is a risk factor for many systemic diseases including adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. In addition, the administration of the periodontopathic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis exacerbates obesity, glucose tolerance, and hepatic steatosis and alters endocrine function in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, the effects of having periodontal disease during pregnancy remain unclear. Thus, this study investigates the effect of P. gingivalis administration on obesity, liver, and BAT during pregnancy. Sonicated P. gingivalis (Pg) or saline (Co) was injected intravenously and administered orally to pregnant C57BL/6J mice three times per week. Maternal body weight and fetal body weight on embryonic day (ED) 18 were evaluated. Microarray analysis and qPCR in the liver and BAT and hepatic and plasma triglyceride quantification were performed on dams at ED 18. The body weight of Pg dams was heavier than that of Co dams; however, the fetal body weight was decreased in the offspring of Pg dams. Microarray analysis revealed 254 and 53 differentially expressed genes in the liver and BAT, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis exhibited the downregulation of fatty acid metabolism gene set in the liver and estrogen response early/late gene sets in the BAT, whereas inflammatory response and IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling gene sets were upregulated both in the liver and BAT. The downregulation of expression levels of Lpin1, Lpin2, and Lxra in the liver, which are associated with triglyceride synthesis, and a decreasing trend in hepatic triglyceride of Pg dams were observed. P. gingivalis administration may alter lipid metabolism in the liver. Overall, the intravenous and oral administration of sonicated P. gingivalis-induced obesity and modified gene expression in the liver and BAT in pregnant mice and caused fetuses to be underweight.

34796193,Translatomics Probes Into the Role of Lycopene on Improving Hepatic Steatosis Induced by High-Fat Diet,"Abstract:Liver is an important organ for fat metabolism. Excessive intake of a high-fat/energy diet is a major cause of hepatic steatosis and its complications such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Supplementation with lycopene, a natural compound, is effective in lowering triglyceride levels in the liver, although the underlying mechanism at the translational level is unclear. In this study, mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce hepatic steatosis and treated with or without lycopene. Translation omics and transcriptome sequencing were performed on the liver to explore the regulatory mechanism of lycopene in liver steatosis induced by HFD, and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We identified 1,358 DEGs at the translational level. Through transcriptomics and translatomics joint analysis, we narrowed the range of functional genes to 112 DEGs and found that lycopene may affect lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of LPIN1 at the transcriptional and translational levels. This study provides a powerful tool for translatome and transcriptome integration and a new strategy for the screening of candidate genes.

23291236,Endoplasmic reticulum stress suppresses lipin-1 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,"Abstract:Lipin-1 plays crucial roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism and cell differentiation in adipocytes. In obesity, adipose lipin-1 mRNA expression is decreased and positively correlated with systemic insulin sensitivity. Amelioration of the lipin-1 depletion might be improved dysmetabolism. Although some cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1β reduces adipose lipin-1 expression, the mechanism of decreased adipose lipin-1 expression in obesity remains unclear. Recently, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity. Here we investigated the role of ER stress on the lipin-1 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We demonstrated that lipin-1 expression was suppressed by the treatment with ER stress inducers (tunicamycin and thapsigargin) at transcriptional level. We also showed that constitutive lipin-1 expression could be maintained by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ recovered the ER stress-induced lipin-1 suppression. These results suggested that ER stress might be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity through lipin-1 depletion."
30511745,Lipin1 is required for skeletal muscle development by regulating MEF2c and MyoD expression,"Abstract                        Key points:                    Lipin1 is critical for skeletal muscle development. Lipin1 regulates MyoD and myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2c) expression via the protein kinase C (PKC)/histone deacetylase 5-mediated pathway. Inhibition of PKCμ activity suppresses myoblast differentiation by inhibiting MyoD and MEF2c expression.              Abstract:                    Our previous characterization of global lipin1-deficient (fld) mice demonstrated that lipin1 played a novel role in skeletal muscle (SM) regeneration. The present study using cell type-specific Myf5-cre;Lipin1fl/fl conditional knockout mice (Lipin1Myf5cKO ) shows that lipin1 is a major determinant of SM development. Lipin1 deficiency induced reduced muscle mass and myopathy. Our results from lipin1-deficient myoblasts suggested that lipin1 regulates myoblast differentiation via the protein kinase Cμ (PKCμ)/histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5)/myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2c):MyoD-mediated pathway. Lipin1 deficiency leads to the suppression of PKC isoform activities, as well as inhibition of the downstream target of PKCμ, class II deacetylase HDAC5 nuclear export, and, consequently, inhibition of MEF2c and MyoD expression in the SM of lipin1Myf5cKO mice. Restoration of diacylglycerol-mediated signalling in lipin1 deficient myoblasts by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate transiently activated PKC and HDAC5, and upregulated MEF2c expression. Our findings provide insights into the signalling circuitry that regulates SM development, and have important implications for developing intervention aimed at treating muscular dystrophy.

26361872,Lipogenesis mitigates dysregulated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake in muscular dystrophy,"Abstract:Muscular dystrophy is accompanied by a reduction in activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) that contributes to abnormal Ca(2+) homeostasis in sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER). Recent findings suggest that skeletal muscle fatty acid synthase (FAS) modulates SERCA activity and muscle function via its effects on SR membrane phospholipids. In this study, we examined muscle's lipid metabolism in mdx mice, a mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). De novo lipogenesis was ~50% reduced in mdx muscles compared to wildtype (WT) muscles. Gene expressions of lipogenic and other ER lipid-modifying enzymes were found to be differentially expressed between wildtype (WT) and mdx muscles. A comprehensive examination of muscles' SR phospholipidome revealed elevated phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PC/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio in mdx compared to WT mice. Studies in primary myocytes suggested that defects in key lipogenic enzymes including FAS, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), and Lipin1 are likely contributing to reduced SERCA activity in mdx mice. Triple transgenic expression of FAS, SCD1, and Lipin1 (3TG) in mdx myocytes partly rescued SERCA activity, which coincided with an increase in SR PE that normalized PC/PE ratio. These findings implicate a defect in lipogenesis to be a contributing factor for SERCA dysfunction in muscular dystrophy. Restoration of muscle's lipogenic pathway appears to mitigate SERCA function through its effects on SR membrane composition.

34068179,Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis Reveals Key Genes and Potential Drugs in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Abstract:Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent aortic disease that causes high mortality due to asymptomatic gradual expansion and sudden rupture. The underlying molecular mechanisms and effective pharmaceutical therapy for preventing AAA progression have not been fully identified. In this study, we identified the key modules and hub genes involved in AAA growth from the GSE17901 dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database through the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Key genes were further selected and validated in the mouse dataset (GSE12591) and human datasets (GSE7084, GSE47472, and GSE57691). Finally, we predicted drug candidates targeting key genes using the Drug-Gene Interaction database. Overall, we identified key modules enriched in the mitotic cell cycle, GTPase activity, and several metabolic processes. Seven key genes (CCR5, ADCY5, ADCY3, ACACB, LPIN1, ACSL1, UCP3) related to AAA progression were identified. A total of 35 drugs/compounds targeting the key genes were predicted, which may have the potential to prevent AAA progression.

22308024,MicroRNA-217 promotes ethanol-induced fat accumulation in hepatocytes by down-regulating SIRT1,"Abstract:Ethanol-mediated inhibition of hepatic sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of this inhibition by identifying a new hepatic target of ethanol action, microRNA-217 (miR-217). The role of miR-217 in the regulation of the effects of ethanol was investigated in cultured mouse AML-12 hepatocytes and in the livers of chronically ethanol-fed mice. In AML-12 hepatocytes and in mouse livers, chronic ethanol exposure drastically and specifically induced miR-217 levels and caused excess fat accumulation. Further studies revealed that overexpression of miR-217 in AML-12 cells promoted ethanol-mediated impairments of SIRT1 and SIRT1-regulated genes encoding lipogenic or fatty acid oxidation enzymes. More importantly, miR-217 impairs functions of lipin-1, a vital lipid regulator, in hepatocytes. Taken together, our novel findings suggest that miR-217 is a specific target of ethanol action in the liver and may present as a potential therapeutic target for treating human alcoholic fatty liver disease."
28755519,Hierarchical role for transcription factors and chromatin structure in genome organization along adipogenesis,"Abstract:The three dimensional folding of mammalian genomes is cell type specific and difficult to alter suggesting that it is an important component of gene regulation. However, given the multitude of chromatin-associating factors, the mechanisms driving the colocalization of active chromosomal domains and the role of this organization in regulating the transcription program in adipocytes are not clear. Analysis of genome-wide chromosomal associations revealed cell type-specific spatial clustering of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 cells. Time course analysis demonstrated that the adipogenic 'hub', sampled by PPARγ and Lpin1, undergoes orchestrated reorganization during adipogenesis. Coupling the dynamics of genome architecture with multiple chromatin datasets indicated that among all the transcription factors (TFs) tested, RXR is central to genome reorganization at the beginning of adipogenesis. Interestingly, at the end of differentiation, the adipogenic hub was shifted to an H3K27me3-repressive environment in conjunction with attenuation of gene transcription. We propose a stage-specific hierarchy for the activity of TFs contributing to the establishment of an adipogenic genome architecture that brings together the adipogenic genetic program. In addition, the repositioning of this network in a H3K27me3-rich environment at the end of differentiation may contribute to the stabilization of gene transcription levels and reduce the developmental plasticity of these specialized cells.              Database:                    All sequence data reported in this paper have been deposited at GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (GSE92475).

24480346,Analyzing the functions and structure of the human lipodystrophy protein seipin,"Abstract:Disruption of the gene BSCL2, which encodes the protein seipin, causes severe generalized lipodystrophy in humans with a near complete absence of adipose tissue. Moreover, cell culture studies have demonstrated that seipin plays a critical cell-autonomous role in adipocyte differentiation. These observations reveal seipin as a critical regulator of human adipose tissue development; however, until recently very little has been known about the potential molecular functions of this intriguing protein. Despite significant recent interest in the function of seipin, our understanding of its molecular role(s) remains limited. The topology of seipin and lack of evidence for any enzymatic domains or activity indicate that it may act principally as a scaffold for other proteins or play a structural role in altering membrane curvature and/or budding. Work in this area has been hampered by several factors, including the lack of homology that might imply testable functions, the poor availability of antibodies to the endogenous protein and the observation that this hydrophobic ER membrane-resident protein is difficult to analyze by standard Western blotting techniques. Here we summarize some of the techniques we have applied to investigate the association of seipin with a recently identified binding partner, lipin 1. In addition, we describe the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to image oligomers of the seipin protein. We believe that AFM will offer a valuable tool to examine the association of candidate binding proteins with the seipin oligomer.

22467849,Hypoxia causes triglyceride accumulation by HIF-1-mediated stimulation of lipin 1 expression,"Abstract:Adaptation to hypoxia involves hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) and requires reprogramming of cellular metabolism that is essential during both physiological and pathological processes. In contrast to the established role of HIF-1 in glucose metabolism, the involvement of HIFs and the molecular mechanisms concerning the effects of hypoxia on lipid metabolism are poorly characterized. Here, we report that exposure of human cells to hypoxia causes accumulation of triglycerides and lipid droplets. This is accompanied by induction of lipin 1, a phosphatidate phosphatase isoform that catalyzes the penultimate step in triglyceride biosynthesis, whereas lipin 2 remains unaffected. Hypoxic upregulation of lipin 1 expression involves predominantly HIF-1, which binds to a single distal hypoxia-responsive element in the lipin 1 gene promoter and causes its activation under low oxygen conditions. Accumulation of hypoxic triglycerides or lipid droplets can be blocked by siRNA-mediated silencing of lipin 1 expression or kaempferol-mediated inhibition of HIF-1. We conclude that direct control of lipin 1 transcription by HIF-1 is an important regulatory feature of lipid metabolism and its adaptation to hypoxia."
29934713,Exendin-4 improves ER stress-induced lipid accumulation and regulates lipin-1 signaling in HepG2 cells,"Abstract:Lipin-1 performs dual function during lipid metabolism, i.e., it functions as a transcriptional coactivator and as a phosphatidate phosphatase during triglyceride biosynthesis. We investigated whether exendin-4 prevented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced hepatic steatosis and whether the protective effects of exendin-4 were associated with lipin-1 signaling. Tunicamycin and thapsigargin, ER stress inducers, increased triglycerides (TG) content and expression of genes encoding lipid droplet surface proteins. Exendin-4 decreased the expression of ER stress markers phosphorylated PKR like ER kinase (PERK), phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α), and glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) proteins and spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1s) mRNA and increased the expression of genes encoding lipolytic enzymes hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and VLDL assembly-associated proteins microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and apolipoprotein B (APOB) in tunicamycin-pretreated cells. Moreover, exendin-4 significantly decreased lipin-1β/α ratio by increasing SFRP10 and increased lipin-1 nuclear localization. The decrease in lipin-1β/α ratio was also observed in SIRT1 and AMPK agonist-treated cells. These data suggest that exendin-4 improves ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing lipolysis and VLDL assembly, which is partially mediated by the regulation of lipin-1 signaling.              Keywords:                    ER stress; Exendin-4; Lipid accumulation; Lipin-1; Lipolysis; VLDL assembly."
31338039,Transcriptomic Responses of Skeletal Muscle to Acute Exercise in Diabetic Goto-Kakizaki Rats,"Abstract:Physical activity exerts positive effects on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is mediated in part by extensive metabolic and molecular remodeling of skeletal muscle in response to exercise, while many regulators of skeletal muscle remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute exercise on skeletal muscle transcriptomic responses in the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats which can spontaneously develop T2D. The transcriptomes of skeletal muscle from both 8-week-old GK and Wistar rats that underwent a single exercise session (60 min running using an animal treadmill at 15 m/min) or remained sedentary were analyzed by next-generation RNA sequencing. We identified 819 differentially expressed genes in the sedentary GK rats compared with those of the sedentary Wistar rats. After a single bout of running, we found 291 and 598 genes that were differentially expressed in the exercise GK and exercise Wistar rats when compared with the corresponding sedentary rats. By integrating our data and previous studies including RNA or protein expression patterns and transgenic experiments, the downregulated expression of Fasn and upregulated expression of Tbc1d1, Hk2, Lpin1, Ppargc1a, Sorbs1, and Hmox1 might enhance glucose uptake or improve insulin sensitivity to ameliorate hyperglycemia in the exercise GK rats. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of exercise on hyperglycemia and insulin action in skeletal muscle of diabetic GK rats.

36918862,Identification of ferroptosis related biomarkers and immune infiltration in Parkinson's disease by integrated bioinformatic analysis,"Abstract                        Background:                    Increasing evidence has indicated that ferroptosis engages in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs), immune infiltration and immune checkpoint genes (ICGs) in the pathogenesis and development of PD.              Methods:                    The microarray data of PD patients and healthy controls (HC) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was downloaded. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was processed to identify the significant modules related to PD in the GSE18838 dataset. Machine learning algorithms were used to screen the candidate biomarkers based on the intersect between WGCNA, FRGs and differentially expressed genes. Enrichment analysis of GSVA, GSEA, GO, KEGG, and immune infiltration, group comparison of ICGs were also performed. Next, candidate biomarkers were validated in clinical samples by ELISA and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to assess diagnose ability.              Results:                    In this study, FRGs had correlations with ICGs, immune infiltration. Then, plasma levels of LPIN1 in PD was significantly lower than that in healthy controls, while the expression of TNFAIP3 was higher in PD in comparison with HC. ROC curves showed that the area under curve (AUC) of the LPIN1 and TNFAIP3 combination was 0.833 (95% CI: 0.750-0.916). Moreover, each biomarker alone could discriminate the PD from HC (LPIN1: AUC = 0.754, 95% CI: 0.659-0.849; TNFAIP3: AUC = 0.754, 95% CI: 0.660-0.849). For detection of early PD from HC, the model of combination maintained diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.734-0.927), LPIN1 also performed well in distinguishing the early PD from HC (AUC = 0.817, 95% CI: 0.717-0.917). However, the diagnostic efficacy was relatively poor in distinguishing the early from middle-advanced PD patients.              Conclusion:                    The combination model composed of LPIN1 and TNFAIP3, and each biomarker may serve as an efficient tool for distinguishing PD from HC.

21478406,Subcellular localization and role of lipin-1 in human macrophages,"Abstract:The lipins have been described as metabolic enzymes that regulate lipid biosynthesis and also signaling processes by controlling the cellular concentration of bioactive lipids, phosphatidic acid, and diacylgycerol. In the present work we have studied the subcellular localization and role of lipin-1 in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Human macrophages express lipin-1 isoforms α and β. A transfected lipin-1α-enhanced GFP construct associates with membranes of cellular organelles that can be stained with Nile Red. Colocalization experiments with lipid droplet (LD)-specific proteins such as adipophilin/adipose differentiation-related protein/perilipin 2 or TIP47/perilipin 3 show that both proteins colocalize with lipin-1α in the same cellular structures. Reduction of the expression levels of lipin-1 by small interfering RNA technology does not impair triacylglycerol biosynthesis but reduces the size of LDs formed in response to oleic acid. In agreement with these data, peritoneal macrophages from animals that carry a mutation in the Lpin-1 gene (fld animals) also produce less and smaller LDs in response to oleic acid. Mass spectrometry determinations demonstrate that the fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol in isolated LDs from lipin-1-deficient cells differs from that of control cells. Moreover, activation of cytosolic group IVA phospholipase A(2)α, a proinflammatory enzyme that is also involved in LD biogenesis, is also compromised in lipin-1-deficient cells. Collectively, these data suggest that lipin-1 associates with LDs and regulates the activation of cytosolic group IVA phospholipase A(2)α in human monocyte-derived macrophages."
22033411,Suppression of lipin-1 expression increases monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,"Abstract:Lipin-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipid metabolism and cell differentiation in adipocytes. Expression of adipose lipin-1 is reduced in obesity, and metabolic syndrome. However, the significance of this reduction remains unclear. This study investigated if and how reduced lipin-1 expression affected metabolism. We assessed mRNA expression levels of various genes related to adipocyte metabolism in lipin-1-depleted 3T3-L1 adipocytes by introducing its specific small interfering RNA. In lipin-1-depleted adipocytes, mRNA and protein expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were significantly increased, although the other genes tested were not altered. The conditioned media from the cells promoted monocyte chemotaxis. The increase in MCP-1 expression was prevented by treatment with quinazoline or salicylate, inhibitors of nuclear factor-κB activation. Because MCP-1 is related to adipose inflammation and systemic insulin resistance, these results suggest that a reduction in adipose lipin-1 in obesity may exacerbate adipose inflammation and metabolism."
25766503,Silencing Mediator of Retinoid and Thyroid Hormone Receptors (SMRT) regulates glucocorticoid action in adipocytes,"Abstract:Local modulation of glucocorticoid action in adipocytes regulates adiposity and systemic insulin sensitivity. However, the specific cofactors that mediate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) action in adipocytes remain unclear. Here we show that the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) is recruited to GR in adipocytes and regulates ligand-dependent GR function. Decreased SMRT expression in adipocytes in vivo increases expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. Moreover, adipocytes with decreased SMRT expression exhibit altered glucocorticoid regulation of lipolysis. We conclude that SMRT regulates the metabolic functions of GR in adipocytes in vivo. Modulation of GR-SMRT interactions in adipocytes represents a novel approach to control the local degree of glucocorticoid action and thus influence adipocyte metabolic function.

21616074,Lipin-1γ isoform is a novel lipid droplet-associated protein highly expressed in the brain,"Abstract:Lipin-1 proteins are phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAPs) catalyzing the conversion from phosphatidic acid (PA) to diacylglycerol (DG). Two alternative splicing isoforms, lipin-1α and -1β, are localized at different subcellular compartments. A third splicing isoform, lipin-1γ was recently cloned and its subcellular localization is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that lipin-1γ is localized to lipid droplets (LDs), an association mediated by a hydrophobic, lipin-1γ-specific domain. Additional expression of lipin-1γ altered LD morphology without affecting the triacylglycerol (TG) level. In human tissues, lipin-1γ is the main lipin-1 isoform expressed in normal human brain, suggesting a specialized role in regulating brain lipid metabolism."
35346479,A high-concentrate diet induces an inflammatory response and oxidative stress and depresses milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland of dairy cows,"Abstract:Although high-concentrate diet feeding can temporarily increase milk production, it can cause a series of metabolic diseases, such as subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) and milk fat depression. The main purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of a high-concentrate diet on the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland of dairy cows. Twelve Holstein cows equipped with rumen fistulas were randomly divided into 2 groups, each with 6 cows, fed a low-concentrate diet (LC) and a high-concentrate diet (HC). On d 20 and 21 of the experiment, rumen fluid was collected to measure pH, and milk samples were collected for milk component analysis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration testing. On d 21, mammary vein blood was collected to detect the LPS concentration. At the end of the 21-d experimental period, mammary gland tissue was collected, and the expression of inflammatory response-, oxidative stress-, and milk fat synthesis-related genes and proteins in the mammary gland was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot. The pH of rumen fluid in the HC group was significantly lower than that in the LC group, and the pH of 2 time points in the HC group was lower than 5.6, indicating that a high-concentrate diet induced SARA. The LPS concentration of the peripheral blood in HC group increased significantly compared with that in the LC group. For the inflammatory response, the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1α) and innate immune factors (lingual antimicrobial peptide and tracheal antimicrobial peptide) in the mammary gland of the HC group were significantly increased, and the TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway was activated. For oxidative stress, after HC diet feeding, the content of malondialdehyde in mammary vein blood and mammary gland tissue increased, the content of glutathione in mammary vein blood decreased, the activity of superoxide dismutase and the total antioxidant capacity in mammary gland tissue and mammary vein blood decreased, and the expression of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) in mammary gland decreased. For milk fat metabolism, HC diet feeding reduced the milk fat content in milk samples and the triacylglycerol content in the mammary gland and inhibited the expression of de novo synthase (ACACA and FASN), long-chain fatty acid converting enzymes (ACSL1 and SCD), fatty acid transporters (CD36, FATP, FABP3, and LPL), triacylglycerol synthase (AGPAT6, DGAT1, and LPIN1), lipid droplet releasing enzyme (PLIN1), and transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG). In summary, a HC diet can induce SARA with increased concentration of LPS in the peripheral vein, stimulate inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress, and inhibit milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland of dairy cows.              Keywords:                    high-concentrate diet; inflammatory response; mammary gland; milk fat depression; oxidative stress."
23787969,Hepatic-specific lipin-1 deficiency exacerbates experimental alcohol-induced steatohepatitis in mice,"Abstract:Lipin-1 regulates lipid metabolism by way of its function as an enzyme in the triglyceride synthesis pathway and as a transcriptional coregulatory protein and is highly up-regulated in alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the present study, using a liver-specific lipin-1-deficient (lipin-1LKO) mouse model, we aimed to investigate the functional role of lipin-1 in the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis and explore the underlying mechanisms. Alcoholic liver injury was achieved by pair feeding wild-type and lipin-1LKO mice with modified Lieber-DeCarli ethanol-containing low-fat diets for 4 weeks. Surprisingly, chronically ethanol-fed lipin-1LKO mice showed markedly greater hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation, and augmented elevation of serum liver enzymes accompanied by increased hepatic proinflammatory cytokine expression. Our studies further revealed that hepatic removal of lipin-1 in mice augmented ethanol-induced impairment of hepatic fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein production, likely by way of deactivation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 alpha, a prominent transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism.              Conclusions:                    Liver-specific lipin-1 deficiency in mice exacerbates the development and progression of experimental alcohol-induced steatohepatitis. Pharmacological or nutritional modulation of hepatic lipin-1 may be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of human alcoholic fatty liver disease."
28347999,Lipin-1 regulation of phospholipid synthesis maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and is critical for triple-negative breast cancer cell survival,"Abstract:Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to increase the synthesis of macromolecules for rapid proliferation. Compared to fatty acids, much less is known about the synthesis of phospholipids, which is essential for membrane biogenesis in cancer cells. We found that LPIN1, which encodes lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) controlling the rate-limiting step in the phospholipid synthesis pathway, is highly up-regulated in basal-like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Moreover, high LPIN1 expression correlates with the poor prognosis of these patients. Knockdown of LPIN1 increases apoptosis in basal-like TNBC cell lines, whereas it has minimal or less effect on normal human mammary gland epithelial cells (HMECs) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines. Fatty acid incorporation and lipidomics analyses showed that LPIN1 knockdown blocks phospholipid synthesis and changes membrane lipid compositions that ultimately induce the activation of 1 of the 3 branches of unfolded protein responses, the inositol-requiring enzyme-1α pathway. We also show for the first time, to our knowledge, that lipin-1 knockdown significantly inhibits tumor growth in vivo using an orthotopic xenograft breast mouse model. Our results suggest that lipin-1 is a potential target for cancer therapy.-He, J., Zhang, F., Tay, L. W. R., Boroda, S., Nian, W., Levental, K. R., Levental, I., Harris, T. E., Chang, J. T., Du, G.

18656451,Potential role of lipin-1 in exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis,"Abstract:Endurance exercise induces mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. It has been shown that lipin-1 acts as a transcriptional coactivator in liver, and stimulates gene expression of mitochondrial enzymes. We hypothesized that lipin-1 might be involved in exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. The present investigation first demonstrated that lipin-1 mRNA in rat triceps muscle was increased by approximately 2-fold after an acute bout of endurance swimming exercise. Second, ectopic expression of lipin-1 in L6 myotube increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and delta-aminolevulinate synthase gene expression. Finally, lipin-1 mRNA expression in rat triceps muscle was significantly elevated at 6h after subcutaneous injections of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) or clenbuterol, which are 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) activators, respectively. These results may suggest that enhanced expression of lipin-1 is involved in exercise-induced mitochondrial enzyme adaptations, possibly through AMPK- and beta2-AR-related mechanisms."
36608563,Comprehensive identification of gene expression fingerprints and biomarkers of sexual endocrine disruption in zebrafish embryo,"Abstract:Endocrine disruptors (EDs), capable of modulating the sex hormone system of an organism, can exert long-lasting negative effects on reproduction in both humans and the environment. For these reasons, the properties of EDs prevent a substance from being approved for marketing. However, regulatory testing to evaluate endocrine disruption is time-consuming, costly, and animal-intensive. Here, we combined sublethal zebrafish embryo assays with transcriptomics and proteomics for well-characterized endocrine disrupting reference compounds to identify predictive biomarkers for sexual endocrine disruption in this model. Using RNA and protein gene expression fingerprints from two different sublethal exposure concentrations, we identified specific signatures and impaired biological processes induced by ethinylestradiol, tamoxifen, methyltestosterone and flutamide 96 h post fertilization (hpf). Our study promotes vtg1 as well as cyp19a1b, fam20cl, lhb, lpin1, nr1d1, fbp1b, and agxtb as promising biomarker candidates for identifying and differentiating estrogen and androgen receptor agonism and antagonism. Evaluation of these biomarkers for pre-regulatory zebrafish embryo-based bioassays will help identify endocrine disrupting hazards of compounds at the molecular level. Such approaches additionally provide weight-of-evidence for the identification of putative EDs and may contribute significantly to a reduction in animal testing in higher tier studies.

24710272,SRSF10 regulates alternative splicing and is required for adipocyte differentiation,"Abstract:During adipocyte differentiation, significant alternative splicing changes occur in association with the adipogenic process. However, little is known about roles played by splicing factors in this process. We observed that mice deficient for the splicing factor SRSF10 exhibit severely impaired development of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) as a result of defects in adipogenic differentiation. To identify splicing events responsible for this, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed using embryonic fibroblast cells. Several SRSF10-affected splicing events that are implicated in adipogenesis have been identified. Notably, lipin1, known as an important regulator during adipogenesis, was further investigated. While lipin1β is mainly involved in lipogenesis, its alternatively spliced isoform lipin1α, generated through the skipping of exon 7, is primarily required for initial adipocyte differentiation. Skipping of exon 7 is controlled by an SRSF10-regulated cis element located in the constitutive exon 8. The activity of this element depends on the binding of SRSF10 and correlates with the relative abundance of lipin1α mRNA. A series of experiments demonstrated that SRSF10 controls the production of lipin1α and thus promotes adipocyte differentiation. Indeed, lipin1α expression could rescue SRSF10-mediated adipogenic defects. Taken together, our results identify SRSF10 as an essential regulator for adipocyte differentiation and also provide new insights into splicing control by SRSF10 in lipin1 pre-mRNA splicing."
17130489,Lipin deficiency impairs diurnal metabolic fuel switching,"Abstract:Fatty liver is a common feature of both obesity and lipodystrophy, reflecting compromised adipose tissue function. The lipin-deficient fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse is an exception, as there is lipodystrophy without a fatty liver. Using a combination of indirect calorimetry and stable-isotope flux phenotyping, we determined that fld mice exhibit abnormal fuel utilization throughout the diurnal cycle, with increased glucose oxidation near the end of the fasting period and increased fatty acid oxidation during the feeding period. The mechanisms underlying these alterations include a twofold increase compared with wild-type mice in tissue glycogen storage during the fed state, a 40% reduction in hepatic glucose production in the fasted state, and a 27-fold increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis in liver during the fed state. Thus, the inability to store energy in adipose tissue in the fld mouse leads to a compensatory increase in glycogen storage for use during the fasting period and reliance upon hepatic fatty acid synthesis to provide fuel for peripheral tissues during the fed state. The increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and peripheral utilization provides a potential mechanism to ameliorate fatty liver in the fld that would otherwise occur as a consequence of adipose tissue dysfunction."
21178827,Adipogenic gene variants in patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy,"Abstract                        Objectives:                    Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been hugely beneficial in the treatment of HIV, HIV lipodystrophy (HIVLD) associated with HAART is a serious adverse effect, with long-term consequences including metabolic disturbances and an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease. Although HIVLD is clearly related to the drug regimen, individual susceptibility also plays a role. We hypothesized that variation in genes regulating adipogenesis, and in those implicated in inherited forms of lipodystrophy, may predispose to the development of HIVLD.              Methods:                    DNA samples were obtained from 180 HAART-treatedHIV+ patients: 124 with HIVLD (HIVLD+) and 56 without HIVLD (HIVLD-). Diagnosis of HIVLD was carried out by clinician's confirmation of patient self-report. High-throughput genotyping using Sequenom was used to screen 62 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes involved in adipogenesis and inherited forms of lipodystrophy. Statistical analysis was performed using Haploview. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) was used to identify independent predictors of HIVLD development in HAART-treated patients.              Results:                    SNPs in two adipogenesis regulators, LPIN1 and CEBPα, showed a significant association with HIVLD whereas a SNP in ZMPSTE24, a zinc metalloproteinase involved in prelamin A processing, showed a trend toward significance. Multivariate analysis identified time since HIV diagnosis (P=0.001) and carriage of more than one associated allele (P=0.008) to be the most significant independent predictors for the development of HIVLD.              Conclusion:                    Genetic variation in key regulators of adipogenesis could interfere with fat storage and metabolism contributing to the development of HIVLD in HAART-treated HIV patients. These results need replication in other cohorts."
30336279,Bta-miR-130a/b regulates preadipocyte differentiation by targeting PPARG and CYP2U1 in beef cattle,"Abstract:Deposition of intramuscular fat (IMF) is one of the most important traits for the evaluation of beef carcass quality grade. MicroRNA (miRNA) is an endogenous non-coding RNA that can play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of mammalian preadipocyte differentiation. Previously, we identified that bta-miR-130a regulates milk fat biosynthesis by targeting PPARG mRNA. However, the role of miR-130 in the regulation of bovine adipocyte differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we found that overexpression of bta-miR-130a/b led to significantly decreased cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) levels during adipogenesis process as well as reduced lipid droplet formation. In contrast, the inhibition of bta-miR-130a/b resulted in larger lipid droplets and TAG accumulation. In addition, overexpression of bta-miR-130a/b inhibited the expression of adipocyte differentiation-related genes, including PPARG, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, FABP4, LPIN1, and LPL. Western blot analysis verified qPCR results on the expression of PPARG and CYP2U1. A luciferase reporter assay further verified bta-miR-130a/b significantly affects PPARG and CYP2U1 expression by directly binding to their 3'-untranslated regions (UTR). We conducted in vitro rescue assay to confirm that bta-miR-130a/b affect bovine adipocyte differentiation by targeting PPARG and CYP2U1. This study shows that bta-miR-130a and bta-miR-130b play similar roles in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation in beef muscles by targeting the 3'UTR of PPARG and CYP2U1. Our result provides a reference for illustrating how noncoding RNAs affects beef quality traits in cattle.

36830461,"Hepatic Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Genes, Polymorphisms, and Molecules Related to Lamb Tenderness","Abstract:Tenderness is a key meat quality trait that determines the public acceptance of lamb consumption, so genetic improvement toward lamb with higher tenderness is pivotal for a sustainable sheep industry. However, unravelling the genomics controlling the tenderness is the first step. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the transcriptome signatures and polymorphisms related to divergent lamb tenderness using RNA deep sequencing. Since the molecules and enzymes that control muscle growth and tenderness are metabolized and synthesized in the liver, hepatic tissues of ten sheep with divergent phenotypes: five high- and five low-lamb tenderness samples were applied for deep sequencing. Sequence analysis identified the number of reads ranged from 21.37 to 25.37 million bases with a mean value of 22.90 million bases. In total, 328 genes are detected as differentially expressed (DEGs) including 110 and 218 genes that were up- and down-regulated, respectively. Pathway analysis showed steroid hormone biosynthesis as the dominant pathway behind the lamb tenderness. Gene expression analysis identified the top high (such as TP53INP1, CYP2E1, HSD17B13, ADH1C, and LPIN1) and low (such as ANGPTL2, IGFBP7, FABP5, OLFML3, and THOC5) expressed candidate genes. Polymorphism and association analysis revealed that mutation in OLFML3, ANGPTL2, and THOC5 genes could be potential candidate markers for tenderness in sheep. The genes and pathways identified in this study cause variation in tenderness, thus could be potential genetic markers to improve meat quality in sheep. However, further validation is needed to confirm the effect of these markers in different sheep populations so that these could be used in a selection program for lamb with high tenderness.

36969298,Case report: Rhabdomyolysis in children in acute and chronic disease-a challenging condition in pediatric emergency medicine,"Abstract:Rhabdomyolysis is a challenging condition in pediatric emergency departments (PED): It ranges from asymptomatic illness with isolated elevation of creatine kinase (CK) levels to a life-threatening condition associated with extreme elevations in CK, electrolyte imbalances, circulatory failure (CF), acute kidney injury (AKI), and multi-organ disease. Most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are viral myositis and trauma, hereditary metabolic myopathies must be considered when facing rhabdomyolysis in early childhood. We report two cases of severe rhabdomyolysis with CF in our PED, thereby summarizing first-line management of rhabdomyolysis.

24303100,Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and altered expression of Ddah1 and Arg1 in mice lacking cavin-1/PTRF,"Abstract:Caveolae are invaginations in the plasma membrane that depend on caveolins and cavins for maturation. Here, we investigated the pulmonary phenotype in mice lacking cavin-1. Bright field and electron-microscopy showed that the cavin-1-deficient mice lacked caveolae in the lung, had an increased lung tissue density, and exhibited hypertrophic remodeling of pulmonary arteries. The right ventricle of the heart moreover had an increased mass and the right ventricular pressure was elevated. A microarray analysis revealed upregulation of Arg1 and downregulation of Ddah1, molecules whose altered expression has previously been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Taken together, this work demonstrates vascular remodeling and increased pulmonary blood pressure in cavin-1 deficient mice and associates this phenotype with altered expression of Arg1 and Ddah1.

34722683,Unraveling the Metabolic Derangements Occurring in Non-infarcted Areas of Pig Hearts With Chronic Heart Failure,"Abstract              Objective: After myocardial infarction (MI), the non-infarcted left ventricle (LV) ensures appropriate contractile function of the heart. Metabolic disturbance in this region greatly exacerbates post-MI heart failure (HF) pathology. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic derangements occurring in the non-infarcted LV that could trigger cardiovascular deterioration. Methods and Results: We used a pig model that progressed into chronic HF over 3 months following MI induction. Integrated gene and metabolite signatures revealed region-specific perturbations in amino acid- and lipid metabolism, insulin signaling and, oxidative stress response. Remote LV, in particular, showed impaired glutamine and arginine metabolism, altered synthesis of lipids, glucose metabolism disorder, and increased insulin resistance. LPIN1, PPP1R3C, PTPN1, CREM, and NR0B2 were identified as the main effectors in metabolism dysregulation in the remote zone and were found differentially expressed also in the myocardium of patients with ischemic and/or dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition, a simultaneous significant decrease in arginine levels and altered PRCP, PTPN1, and ARF6 expression suggest alterations in vascular function in remote area. Conclusions: This study unravels an array of dysregulated genes and metabolites putatively involved in maladaptive metabolic and vascular remodeling in the non-infarcted myocardium and may contribute to the development of more precise therapies to mitigate progression of chronic HF post-MI.

21397848,piRNA-associated germline nuage formation and spermatogenesis require MitoPLD profusogenic mitochondrial-surface lipid signaling,"Abstract:The mammalian Phospholipase D MitoPLD facilitates mitochondrial fusion by generating the signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA). The Drosophila MitoPLD homolog Zucchini (Zuc), a proposed cytoplasmic nuclease, is required for piRNA generation, a critical event in germline development. We show that Zuc localizes to mitochondria and has MitoPLD-like activity. Conversely, MitoPLD(-/-) mice exhibit the meiotic arrest, DNA damage, and male sterility characteristic of mice lacking piRNAs. The primary function of MitoPLD seems to be the generation of mitochondrial-surface PA. This PA in turn recruits the phosphatase Lipin 1, which converts PA to diacylglycerol and promotes mitochondrial fission, suggesting a mechanism for mitochondrial morphology homeostasis. MitoPLD and Lipin 1 have opposing effects on mitochondria length and on intermitochondrial cement (nuage), a structure found between aggregated mitochondria that is implicated in piRNA generation. We propose that mitochondrial-surface PA generated by MitoPLD/Zuc recruits or activates nuage components critical for piRNA production."
35946924,Transcriptome analysis reveals candidate genes of the synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids related to mutton flavor in the lamb liver using Allium mongolicum Regel extract,"Abstract:The objective of this study was to identify candidate genes via which Allium mongolicum Regel ethanol extract (AME) affects the synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) related to mutton flavor by transcriptome analysis in the lamb liver. Thirty male Small-tailed Han sheep (3 mo old; 33.6 ± 1.2 kg) were randomly divided into two groups and fed for 75 d with a basal diet containing no AME (CON, control group) or 2.8 g·lamb-1·d-1 AME (AME group). Twelve sheep, CON (n = 6) and AME (n = 6), were selected for slaughter at the end of the trial period, and liver samples were subsequently collected. There was no difference in 4-ethyloctanoic acid content among treatments. The 4-methyloctanoic acid and 4-methylnonanoic acid levels were significantly lower in the AME group than in the CON group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, 461 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the CON and AME groups, of which 182 were upregulated and 279 were downregulated in the AME group. The DEGs were enriched in three pathways, namely, glutathione metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction, and steroid hormone biosynthesis, as determined by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. Finally, CYP2B6, ACOT12, THEM4, ACSF2, LPIN1, and ADCY4 were identified as candidate genes that might be involved in regulating the BCFAs synthesis in the sheep liver.              Keywords:                    Allium mongolicum Regel extract; branched-chain fatty acids; lamb; liver transcriptome; mutton flavor."
19494125,Lipin is required for efficient breakdown of the nuclear envelope in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Abstract:The nuclear envelope (NE) is a double lipid bilayer that separates nucleus and cytoplasm. In metazoa, NE breakdown (NEBD) occurs during prophase and NE reformation around segregated chromatids occurs at anaphase-telophase. We identified Caenorhabditis elegans Lipin homologue (called Lpin-1) as an essential factor with roles in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) organization and NEBD. RNAi-mediated downregulation of Lpin-1 had no effect on timely entry into mitosis or on the early steps of NEBD, but Lpin-1 was required for disassembly of the nuclear lamina during late NEBD. This Lpin-1 requirement appears to be separable from the effect of Lpin-1 on the peripheral ER."
26232522,"Transcriptional profiling of rat white adipose tissue response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin","Abstract:Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins are environmental contaminants commonly produced as a by-product of industrial processes. The most potent of these, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin (TCDD), is highly lipophilic, leading to bioaccumulation. White adipose tissue (WAT) is a major site for energy storage, and is one of the organs in which TCDD accumulates. In laboratory animals, exposure to TCDD causes numerous metabolic abnormalities, including a wasting syndrome. We therefore investigated the molecular effects of TCDD exposure on WAT by profiling the transcriptomic response of WAT to 100μg/kg of TCDD at 1 or 4days in TCDD-sensitive Long-Evans (Turku/AB; L-E) rats. A comparative analysis was conducted simultaneously in identically treated TCDD-resistant Han/Wistar (Kuopio; H/W) rats one day after exposure to the same dose. We sought to identify transcriptomic changes coinciding with the onset of toxicity, while gaining additional insight into later responses. More transcriptional responses to TCDD were observed at 4days than at 1day post-exposure, suggesting WAT shows mostly secondary responses. Two classic AHR-regulated genes, Cyp1a1 and Nqo1, were significantly induced by TCDD in both strains, while several genes involved in the immune response, including Ms4a7 and F13a1 were altered in L-E rats alone. We compared genes affected by TCDD in rat WAT and human adipose cells, and observed little overlap. Interestingly, very few genes involved in lipid metabolism exhibited altered expression levels despite the pronounced lipid mobilization from peripheral fat pads by TCDD in L-E rats. Of these genes, the lipolysis-associated Lpin1 was induced slightly over 2-fold in L-E rat WAT on day 4.

34197731,Whole-exome sequencing reveals common and rare variants in immunologic and neurological genes implicated in achalasia,"Abstract:Idiopathic achalasia (IA) is a severe motility disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration in the myenteric plexus, but the etiology remains largely unknown. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 100 IA-affected individuals and 313 non-IA control subjects and validated the results in 230 IA-affected individuals and 1,760 non-IA control subjects. Common missense variants rs1705003 (CUTA, GenBank: NC_000006.11:g.33385953A>G) and rs1126511 (HLA-DPB1, GenBank: NC_000006.11:g.33048466G>T) at 6p21.32 were reproducibly associated with increased risk of IA (rs1126511: OR = 1.83, p = 2.34 × 10-9; rs1705003: OR = 2.37, p = 3.21 × 10-7), meeting exome-wide significance. Both variants can affect the expression of their target genes at the transcript level. An array-based association analysis in 280 affected individuals and 1,121 control subjects determined the same signal at 6p21.32. Further conditional analyses supported that the two missense variants identified in WES-based association study were potential causal variants of IA. For rare variants, the top genes identified by gene-based analysis were significantly enriched in nerve and muscle phenotypic genes in the mouse. Moreover, the functional rare variants in these genes tended to cooccur in IA-affected individuals. In an independent cohort, we successfully validated three rare variants (CREB5, GenBank: NC_000007.13:g.28848865G>T; ESYT3, GenBank: NC_000003.11:g.138183253C>T; and LPIN1, GenBank: NC_000002.11:g.11925128A>G) which heightens the risk of developing IA. Our study identified and validated two common variants and three rare variants associated with IA in immunologic and neurological genes, providing new insight into the etiology of IA.

34029162,β2-Adrenergic receptor agonist induced hepatic steatosis in mice: modeling nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in hyperadrenergic states,"Abstract:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disorders ranging from hepatic steatosis [excessive accumulation of triglycerides (TG)] to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The molecular pathogenesis of steatosis and progression to more severe NAFLD remains unclear. Obesity and aging, two principal risk factors for NAFLD, are associated with a hyperadrenergic state. β-Adrenergic responsiveness in liver increases in animal models of obesity and aging, and in both is linked to increased hepatic expression of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs). We previously showed that in aging rodents intracellular signaling from elevated hepatic levels of β2-ARs may contribute to liver steatosis. In this study we demonstrate that injection of formoterol, a highly selective β2-AR agonist, to mice acutely results in hepatic TG accumulation. Further, we have sought to define the intrahepatic mechanisms underlying β2-AR mediated steatosis by investigating changes in hepatic expression and cellular localization of enzymes, transcription factors, and coactivators involved in processes of lipid accrual and disposition-and also functional aspects thereof-in livers of formoterol-treated animals. Our results suggest that β2-AR activation by formoterol leads to increased hepatic TG synthesis and de novo lipogenesis, increased but incomplete β-oxidation of fatty acids with accumulation of potentially toxic long-chain acylcarnitine intermediates, and reduced TG secretion-all previously invoked as contributors to fatty liver disease. Experiments are ongoing to determine whether sustained activation of hepatic β2-AR signaling by formoterol might be utilized to model fatty liver changes occurring in hyperadrenergic states of obesity and aging, and thereby identify novel molecular targets for the prevention or treatment of NAFLD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Results of our study suggest that β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) activation by agonist formoterol leads to increased hepatic TG synthesis and de novo lipogenesis, incomplete β-oxidation of fatty acids with accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitine intermediates, and reduced TG secretion. These findings may, for the first time, implicate a role for β2-AR responsive dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism in the pathogenetic processes underlying NAFLD in hyperadrenergic states such as obesity and aging.

30141807,Iron depletion participates in the suppression of cell proliferation induced by lipin1 overexpression,"Abstract:Lipin1 participates in numerous cellular processes, including in the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and as a co-transcriptional regulator. Iron is also essential in various critical biological processes. Previous studies have shown that compared to normal tissue cells, lipin1 expression and iron metabolism are abnormal in cancer cells. However, the involvement of lipin1 in the regulation of iron metabolism is unknown. In this study, we compared the contents of eight metal ions (potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, iron and copper) in human hepatoma carcinoma BEL7402 control cells as well as stable cells overexpressing lipin1 by using ICP-AES. Our results showed that only intracellular iron content was significantly decreased by lipin1 overexpression. Meanwhile, we observed that lipin1 overexpression could inhibit cell proliferation, similar to iron chelator deferoxamine. Western blotting showed that the up-regulation of p53-p21-p27 elicited cell cycle G0/G1 arrest in the stable cells overexpressing lipin1. Conversely, after lipin1 was down regulated with siRNA, we found that cell proliferation was promoted, accompanied by an increase in iron content, and the downregulation of p53 and p21. Our data indicate that lipin1 overexpression may cause reduction of intracellular iron content, which could activate the p53-p21-p27 signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in the hepatic carcinoma cells. Subsequently, we identified the putative cause for the decrease of the intracellular iron content induced by lipin1 overexpression. Our results suggested that the intracellular iron reduction was due to the increase in the expression of ferroportin, an iron export protein in the stable cells overexpressing lipin1. In contrast, after transfection with lipin1 siRNA, the decreased expression of ferroportin contributed to an increase in the iron content in BEL7402 cells. It was further confirmed that the intracellular iron content was increased after ferroportin was knocked down by siRNA in BEL7402 cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that lipin1 participates in the regulation of iron metabolism in human hepatic carcinoma cells. This suggests that lipin1 may play an important protective role in inhibiting the development of cancer through the reduction of iron content in tumors, which further demonstrates that iron reduction could be a potential strategy of cancer prevention and treatment."
34606535,MicroRNA-432 inhibits milk fat synthesis by targeting SCD and LPL in ovine mammary epithelial cells,"Abstract:The microRNA (miR)-432 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of two breeds of lactating sheep with different milk production traits, and between the non-lactating and peak-lactation periods, but there have been no reports describing the molecular mechanisms involved. In this study, the effect of miR-432 on the proliferation of ovine mammary epithelial cells (OMECs) and the target genes of miR-432 were investigated. The effects of miR-432 on the expression of the target genes and the content of triglycerides in the OMECs were also analyzed. Transfection with a miR-432 mimic was found using CCK8 and Edu assays, to inhibit the viability of OMECs and reduce the number of proliferated OMECs. In contrast, a miR-432 inhibitor had the opposite effect to the miR-432 mimic, and together these results suggest that miR-432 inhibits the proliferation of OMECs. A dual luciferase assay revealed that the genes for stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are targeted by miR-432. The transfection of miR-432 mimic into OMECs resulted in decreases in the expression of SCD and LPL, and three other milk fat synthesis marker genes; FABP4, LPIN1 and ACACA. The mimic also decreased the content of triglycerides. The miR-432 inhibitor had the opposite effect to the mimic on the expression of these genes and the level of triglycerides. This is the first study to reveal the biological mechanisms by which miR-432 inhibits milk fat synthesis in sheep."
18070763,Association of lipin 1 gene polymorphisms with measures of energy and glucose metabolism,"Abstract                        Objective:                    To examine the importance of lipin 1 (LPIN1) gene variation in energy and glucose metabolism. Transgenic animal models have shown that lipin, a protein encoded by the LPIN1 gene, promotes fat synthesis and storage in adipose tissue while decreasing energy expenditure and lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Lpin1 was identified as the mutated gene in the fatty liver dystrophy mouse, which exhibits lipin deficiency and features of human lipodystrophy.              Research methods and procedures:                    We genotyped five LPIN1 polymorphisms and tested for association with resting metabolic rate (RMR), fat oxidation, fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentration, and obesity-related phenotypes, including BMI, body fat percentage, sum of six skinfolds, and waist circumference in 712 subjects of the Quebec Family Study.              Results:                    The strongest results were generation-specific. In parents, RMR of the G/G IVS13 + 3333A>G homozygotes was 107 kcal/d higher than in A/A homozygotes and 39 kcal/d higher than in A/G heterozygotes (p = 0.0003). In offspring, carriers of the C allele of the IVS18 + 181C>T variant had significantly higher (p < 0.0003) insulin levels than T/T homozygotes. These associations remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Several other associations between body composition measures and the IVS18 + 181C>T variant were significant (p = 0.05 to 0.003), suggesting a strong pattern of relationships.              Discussion:                    These findings support the hypothesis that sequence variation in the LPIN1 gene contributes to variation in RMR and obesity-related phenotypes potentially in an age-dependent manner."
29217509,Macrophage-Associated Lipin-1 Enzymatic Activity Contributes to Modified Low-Density Lipoprotein-Induced Proinflammatory Signaling and Atherosclerosis,"Abstract                        Objective:                    Macrophage proinflammatory responses induced by modified low-density lipoproteins (modLDL) contribute to atherosclerotic progression. How modLDL causes macrophages to become proinflammatory is still enigmatic. Macrophage foam cell formation induced by modLDL requires glycerolipid synthesis. Lipin-1, a key enzyme in the glycerolipid synthesis pathway, contributes to modLDL-elicited macrophage proinflammatory responses in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine whether macrophage-associated lipin-1 contributes to atherogenesis and to assess its role in modLDL-mediated signaling in macrophages.              Approach and results:                    We developed mice lacking lipin-1 in myeloid-derived cells and used adeno-associated viral vector 8 expressing the gain-of-function mutation of mouse proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (adeno-associated viral vector 8-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) to induce hypercholesterolemia and plaque formation. Mice lacking myeloid-associated lipin-1 had reduced atherosclerotic burden compared with control mice despite similar plasma lipid levels. Stimulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages with modLDL activated a persistent protein kinase Cα/βII-extracellular receptor kinase1/2-jun proto-oncogene signaling cascade that contributed to macrophage proinflammatory responses that was dependent on lipin-1 enzymatic activity.              Conclusions:                    Our data demonstrate that macrophage-associated lipin-1 is atherogenic, likely through persistent activation of a protein kinase Cα/βII-extracellular receptor kinase1/2-jun proto-oncogene signaling cascade that contributes to foam cell proinflammatory responses. Taken together, these results suggest that modLDL-induced foam cell formation and modLDL-induced macrophage proinflammatory responses are not independent consequences of modLDL stimulation but rather are both directly influenced by enhanced lipid synthesis.

34830942,High Grade of Amplification of Six Regions on Chromosome 2p in a Neuroblastoma Patient with Very Poor Outcome: The Putative New Oncogene TSSC1,"Abstract:We observed a case of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) carried by a 28-month-old girl, displaying metastatic disease and a rapid decline of clinical conditions. By array-CGH analysis of the tumor tissue and of the metastatic bone marrow aspirate cells, we found a high-grade amplification of six regions besides MYCN on bands 2p25.3-p24.3. The genes involved in these amplifications were MYT1L, TSSC1, CMPK2, RSAD2, RNF144A, GREB1, NTSR2, LPIN1, NBAS, and the two intergenic non-protein coding RNAs LOC730811 and LOC339788. We investigated if these DNA co-amplifications may have an effect on enhancing tumor aggressiveness. We evaluated the association between the high expression of the amplified genes and NB patient's outcome using the integration of gene expression data of 786 NB samples profiled with different public platforms from patients with at least five-year follow-up. NB patients with high expression of the TSSC1 gene were associated with a reduced survival rate. Immunofluorescence staining on primary tumor tissues confirmed that the TSSC1 protein expression was high in the relapsed or dead stage 4 cases, but it was generally low in NB patients in complete remission. TSSC1 appears as a putative new oncogene in NB.              Keywords:                    TSSC1; gene expression; genomic amplification; neuroblastoma; survival."
21779369,Transgenic overexpression of Tcfap2c/AP-2gamma results in liver failure and intestinal dysplasia,"Abstract                        Background:                    The transcription factor Tcfap2c has been demonstrated to be essential for various processes during mammalian development. It has been found to be upregulated in various undifferentiated tumors and is implicated with poor prognosis. Tcfap2c is reported to impinge on cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. However, the physiological consequences of Tcfap2c-expression remain largely unknown.              Methodology/principal findings:                    Therefore we established a gain of function model to analyze the role of Tcfap2c in development and disease. Induction of the transgene led to robust expression in all tissues (except brain and testis) and lead to rapid mortality within 3-7 days. In the liver cellular proliferation and apoptosis was detected. Accumulation of microvesicular lipid droplets and breakdown of major hepatic metabolism pathways resulted in steatosis. Serum analysis showed a dramatic increase of enzymes indicative for hepatic failure. After induction of Tcfap2c we identified a set of 447 common genes, which are deregulated in both liver and primary hepatocyte culture. Further analysis showed a prominent repression of the cytochrome p450 system, PPARA, Lipin1 and Lipin2. These data indicate that in the liver Tcfap2c represses pathways, which are responsible for fatty acid metabolism. In the intestine, Tcfap2c expression resulted in expansion of Sox9 positive and proliferative active epithelial progenitor cells resulting in dysplastic growth of mucosal crypt cells and loss of differentiated mucosa.              Conclusions:                    The transgenic mice show that ectopic expression of Tcfap2c is not tolerated. Due to the phenotype observed, iTcfap2c-mice represent a model system to study liver failure. In intestine, Tcfap2c induced cellular hyperplasia and suppressed terminal differentiation indicating that Tcfap2c serves as a repressor of differentiation and inducer of proliferation. This might be achieved by the Tcfap2c mediated activation of Sox9 known to be expressed in intestinal and hepatic stem/progenitor cell populations."
19553673,Sterol-mediated regulation of human lipin 1 gene expression in hepatoblastoma cells,"Abstract:Lipin 1 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Its physiological role involves two cellular functions: regulation of phosphatidate phosphatase activity and regulation of fatty acid oxidation. In this study, we have demonstrated that lipin 1 gene (LPIN1) expression is regulated by cellular sterols, which are key regulators of lipid metabolism. We have also characterized the sterol-response element and nuclear factor Y-binding sites in the human LPIN1 promoter. Using a luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that these elements are responsible for the transcription of LPIN1 gene, mediated by SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1) and nuclear factor Y. Furthermore, we investigated whether lipin 1 is involved in lipogenesis by transfection of LPIN1 small interfering RNA. We infer that sterol-mediated regulation of lipin 1 gene transcription modulates triglyceride accumulation. This modulation involves changes in the activity of phosphatidate phosphatase."
26475860,The Catalytic Efficiency of Lipin 1β Increases by Physically Interacting with the Proto-oncoprotein c-Fos,"Abstract:Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a central precursor for membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. The lipin family is a magnesium-dependent type I PA phosphatase involved in de novo synthesis of neutral lipids and phospholipids. The regulation of lipin activity may govern the pathways by which these lipids are synthesized and control the cellular levels of important signaling lipids. Moreover, the proto-oncoprotein c-Fos has an emerging role in glycerolipid synthesis regulation; by interacting with key synthesizing enzymes it is able to increase overall phospho- and glycolipid synthesis. We studied the lipin 1β enzyme activity in a cell-free system using PA/Triton X-100 mixed micelles as substrate, analyzing it in the presence/absence of c-Fos. We found that lipin 1β kcat value increases around 40% in the presence of c-Fos, with no change in the lipin 1β affinity for the PA/Triton X-100 mixed micelles. We also probed a physical interaction between both proteins. Although the c-Fos domain involved in lipin activation is its basic domain, the interaction domain is mapped to the N-terminal c-Fos. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a novel positive regulator of lipin 1β PA phosphatase activity that is not achieved via altering its subcellular localization or affinity for membranes but rather through directly increasing its catalytic efficiency.               Keywords:                    Forster resonance energy transfer; c-Fos; enzyme mechanism; lipin; membrane biogenesis; phosphatase; phosphatidic acid; phospholipid metabolism; protein/protein interaction."
33682250,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma regulates genes involved in milk fat synthesis in mammary epithelial cells of water buffalo,"Abstract:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a critical transcription factor regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. However, the regulatory effect of PPARγ on milk fat synthesis in buffalo mammary gland is not clear. In order to explore the role of buffalo PPARG gene in milk fat synthesis, lentivirus-mediated interference was used to knock it down and then the recombinant fusion expression vector was transfected into buffalo mammary epithelial cell (BMEC) to overexpress it. PPARG gene knockdown significantly decreased the expression of CD36, FABP3, FABP4, ACSS2, ELOVL6, DGAT2, BTN1A1, AGPAT6, LPIN1, ABCG2, PPARGC1A, INSIG1, FASN, and SREBF2 genes and significantly upregulated the expression of INSIG2 gene but had no significant effect on the expression of ACSL1, GPAM, and SREBF1 genes. PPARG overexpression significantly increased the relative mRNA abundance of CD36, FABP3, FABP4, ACSS2, ELOVL6, DGAT2, BTN1A1, AGPAT6, LPIN1, PPARGC1A, INSIG1, and SREBF2 genes and significantly downregulated the expression of INSIG2 gene but had no significant effect on the expression of ACSL1, GPAM, ABCG2, FASN, and SREBF1 genes. In addition, knockdown/overexpression of PPARG gene significantly decreased/increased triacylglycerol (TAG) content in BMECs. This study revealed that buffalo PPARG gene is a key gene regulating buffalo milk fat synthesis.              Keywords:                    PPARG; knockdown; milk fat synthesis; overexpression; water buffalo."
29740082,Transcriptome analyses reveal reduced hepatic lipid synthesis and accumulation in more feed efficient beef cattle,"Abstract:The genetic mechanisms controlling residual feed intake (RFI) in beef cattle are still largely unknown. Here we performed whole transcriptome analyses to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes and their functional roles in liver tissues between six extreme high and six extreme low RFI steers from three beef breed populations including Angus, Charolais, and Kinsella Composite (KC). On average, the next generation sequencing yielded 34 million single-end reads per sample, of which 87% were uniquely mapped to the bovine reference genome. At false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and fold change (FC) > 2, 72, 41, and 175 DE genes were identified in Angus, Charolais, and KC, respectively. Most of the DE genes were breed-specific, while five genes including TP53INP1, LURAP1L, SCD, LPIN1, and ENSBTAG00000047029 were common across the three breeds, with TP53INP1, LURAP1L, SCD, and LPIN1 being downregulated in low RFI steers of all three breeds. The DE genes are mainly involved in lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, energy production, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry, cellular development, and cell death and survival. Furthermore, our differential gene expression results suggest reduced hepatic lipid synthesis and accumulation processes in more feed efficient beef cattle of all three studied breeds."
22337502,Aging of myelinating glial cells predominantly affects lipid metabolism and immune response pathways,"Abstract:Both the central and the peripheral nervous systems are prone to multiple age-dependent neurological deficits, often attributed to still unknown alterations in the function of myelinating glia. To uncover the biological processes affected in glial cells by aging, we analyzed gene expression of the Schwann cell-rich mouse sciatic nerve at 17 time points throughout life, from day of birth until senescence. By combining these data with the gene expression data of myelin mouse mutants carrying deletions of either Pmp22, SCAP, or Lpin1, we found that the majority of age-related transcripts were also affected in myelin mutants (54.4%) and were regulated during PNS development (59.5%), indicating a high level of overlap in implicated molecular pathways. The expression profiles in aging copied the direction of transcriptional changes observed in neuropathy models; however, they had the opposite direction when compared with PNS development. The most significantly altered biological processes in aging involved the inflammatory/immune response and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, both these pathways were comparably changed in the aging optic nerve, suggesting that similar biological processes are affected in aging of glia-rich parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Our comprehensive comparison of gene expression in three distinct biological conditions including development, aging, and myelin disease thus revealed a previously unanticipated relationship among themselves and identified lipid metabolism and inflammatory/immune response pathways as potential therapeutical targets to prevent or delay so far incurable age-related and inherited forms of neuropathies."
21157865,Lyso-form fragment ions facilitate the determination of stereospecificity of diacyl glycerophospholipids,"Abstract:In this work we report the development of a novel methodology for the determination of stereospecificity of diacyl glycerophospholipids, including glycerophosphatidic acids (PA), glycerophosphoserines (PS), glycerophosphoglycerols (PG), glycerophosphoinositols (PI), and glycerophosphoethanolamines (PE), which can be conventionally ionized in negative ion mode. This methodology uses MS(2) recorded on a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer to determine the stereospecificity of diacyl glycerophospholipids based on the lyso-form fragment ions, attributed to the neutral loss of fatty acyl moieties. The fragmentation patterns of a variety of diacyl glycerophospholipid standards were first fully examined over a wide range of collision energy. We observed that lyso-form fragment ions corresponding to the neutral loss of fatty acyl moieties attached to the sn2 position as free fatty acids ([M-Sn2](-) ) and as ketenes ([M-(Sn2-H(2) O)](-) ) exhibited consistently higher intensity than their counterpart ions due to the neutral loss of fatty acyl moieties attached to the sn1 position ([M-Sn1](-) and [M-(Sn1-H(2) O)](-) ). Therefore, we concluded that an empirical fragmentation rule can be used to precisely determine the stereospecificity of diacyl glycerophospholipids, primarily on the basis of relative abundance of the lyso-form fragment ions. We then examined the product ion spectra of diacyl glycerophospholipids recorded from lipid extracts of rat hepatoma cells, where the stereospecific information of these lipids was conclusively determined. Combining the novel methodology reported in this work with the currently widely practiced mass spectrometric techniques such as multiple precursor ion scans (MPIS), fatty acyl scans (FAS), and multidimensional mass spectrometry based shotgun lipidomics (MDMS-SL), should enable a reliable and convenient platform for comprehensive glycerophospholipid profiling."
23065777,Negative control of mast cell degranulation and the anaphylactic response by the phosphatase lipin1,"Abstract:Mast cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases; however, how mast cell function is regulated is still not well understood. Both phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) are important secondary messengers involved in mast cell activ-ation. Lipin1 is a phosphatidate phosphatase that hydrolyzes PA to produce DAG, but the role of lipin1 in mast cell function has been thus far unknown. Here we show that lipin1 is an important and selective inhibitor of mast cell degranulation. Lipin1 deficiency enhanced FcεRI-mediated β-hexosaminidase and prostaglandin D2 release from mast cells in vitro and exacerbated the passive systemic anaphylaxis reaction in vivo. Lipin1 deficiency, however, did not exert obvious effects on IL-6 or TNF-α production following FcεRI engagement. FcεRI-induced PKC and SNAP-23 phosphorylation were augmented in the lipin1-deficient mast cells. Moreover, inhibition of PKC activity reduced SNAP-23 phosphorylation and mast cell degranulation in lipin1-deficient mast cells. Together, our findings suggest that lipin1 may negatively control mast cell degranulation and the anaphylactic response through inhibiting the PKC-SNAP-23 pathway."
27345520,The Role of Lipin-1 in the Regulation of Fibrogenesis and TGF-β Signaling in Hepatic Stellate Cells,"Abstract:The adipogenic transcriptional regulation was reported to inhibit transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which constitute the main fibrogenic cell type in the liver. Lipin-1 exhibits a dual function: an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol and a transcriptional regulator. However, the involvement of Lipin-1 in the regulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and fibrogenesis in HSCs is not fully understood. Here, we showed that Lipin-1 was downregulated in activated primary HSCs and TGF-β-treated LX-2 cells, immortalized human HSC cell lines. The downregulation of Lipin-1 by TGF-β was not dependent on altered mRNA stability but rather on protein stability. Treatment of LX-2 cells with the proteasome inhibitor led to the accumulation of Lipin-1. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in Lipin-1 polyubiquitination. Overexpression of Lipin-1 attenuated TGF-β-induced fibrogenic gene expression. In addition, Lipin-1 inhibited TGF-β-mediated activation of Sma and Mad-related family (SMAD), a major transcription factor that transduces intracellular signals from TGF-β. Resveratrol, a well-known natural polyphenolic antioxidant, is known to inhibit liver fibrosis, although its mechanism of action remains unknown. Our data showed that resveratrol significantly increased the levels of Lipin-1 protein and mRNA in HSCs. Further investigation revealed that resveratrol blocked the polyubiquitination of Lipin-1. Resveratrol inhibited TGF-β-induced fibrogenic gene expression. TGF-β-induced SMAD binding element-luciferase reporter activity was significantly diminished by resveratrol with a simultaneous decrease in SMAD3 phosphorylation. Consistently, knockdown of the Lipin-1 gene using siRNA abolished the inhibitory effect of resveratrol. We conclude that Lipin-1 can antagonize HSC activation through the inhibition of TGF-β/SMAD signaling and that resveratrol may affect Lipin-1 gene induction and contribute to the inhibition of TGF-β-mediated hepatic fibrogenesis.              Keywords:                    Lipin-1; TGF-β; fibrogenesis.; hepatic stellate cells; resveratrol; ubiquitination."
21413788,Homo sapiens dullard protein phosphatase shows a preference for the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site of lipin1,"Abstract:Human lipin1 catalyzes the highly regulated conversion of phosphatidic acids to diacylglycerides. Lipin's cellular location, protein partners, and biological function are directed by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events catalyzed by the phosphoserine phosphatase dullard. To define the determinants of dullard substrate recognition and catalysis, and hence, lipin regulation, steady-state kinetic analysis was performed on phosphoserine-bearing nonapeptides based on the phosphorylation sites of lipin. The results demonstrate that dullard shows specificity for the peptide corresponding to the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site (Ser106) of lipin with a k(cat)/K(m) of 2.9 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). These results are consistent with a coil-loop structure for the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site on human lipin1 and make unlikely the requirement for an adaptor protein to confer activity such as that proposed for the yeast homologue."
19753306,Sumoylation regulates nuclear localization of lipin-1alpha in neuronal cells,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a protein that has dual functions as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) and a nuclear transcriptional coactivator. It remains unknown how the nuclear localization and coactivator functions of lipin-1 are regulated. Here, we show that lipin-1 (including both the alpha and beta isoforms) is modified by sumoylation at two consensus sumoylation sites. We are unable to detect sumoylation of the related proteins lipin-2 and lipin-3. Lipin-1 is sumoylated at relatively high levels in brain, where lipin-1alpha is the predominant form. In cultured embryonic cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, ectopically expressed lipin-1alpha is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and the nuclear localization is abrogated by mutating the consensus sumyolation motifs. The sumoylation site mutant of lipin-1alpha loses the capacity to coactivate the transcriptional (co-) activators PGC-1alpha and MEF2, consistent with its nuclear exclusion. Thus, these results show that sumoylation facilitates the nuclear localization and transcriptional coactivator behavior of lipin-1alpha that we observe in cultured neuronal cells, and suggest that lipin-1alpha may act as a sumoylation-regulated transcriptional coactivator in brain."
28982975,"The phosphatidic acid-binding, polybasic domain is responsible for the differences in the phosphoregulation of lipins 1 and 3","Abstract:Lipins 1, 2, and 3 are Mg2+-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatases and catalyze the penultimate step of triacylglycerol synthesis. We have previously investigated the biochemistry of lipins 1 and 2 and shown that di-anionic phosphatidic acid (PA) augments their activity and lipid binding and that lipin 1 activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. In the present study, we show that phosphorylation does not affect the catalytic activity of lipin 3 or its ability to associate with PA in vitro The lipin proteins each contain a conserved polybasic domain (PBD) composed of nine lysine and arginine residues located between the conserved N- and C-terminal domains. In lipin 1, the PBD is the site of PA binding and sensing of the PA electrostatic charge. The specific arrangement and number of the lysines and arginines of the PBD vary among the lipins. We show that the different PBDs of lipins 1 and 3 are responsible for the presence of phosphoregulation on the former but not the latter enzyme. To do so, we generated lipin 1 that contained the PBD of lipin 3 and vice versa. The lipin 1 enzyme with the lipin 3 PBD lost its ability to be regulated by phosphorylation but remained downstream of phosphorylation by mammalian target of rapamycin. Conversely, the presence of the lipin 1 PBD in lipin 3 subjected the enzyme to negative intramolecular control by phosphorylation. These results indicate a mechanism for the observed differences in lipin phosphoregulation in vitro.

34746177,Genetic Polymorphisms and Clinical Features in Diabetic Patients With Fatty Liver: Results From a Single-Center Experience in Southern Italy,"Abstract:Genetic background may be involved in the promotion and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies have suggested that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be associated with the specific clinical features in the patients with hepatic steatosis; however, data on the patients with diabetes from Southern Italy are lacking. We enrolled 454 patients and 260 of them had type 2 diabetes. We studied the PNPLA3 rs738409, LPIN1 rs13412852, KLF6 rs3750861, SOD2 rs4880, TM6SF2 rs58542926, and ZNF624 rs12603226 SNPs and their distribution in the study population. Lipid profile, liver stiffness, and kidney function were also studied to understand the potential role of the SNPs in the development of clinical phenotypes. No differences were observed in the distribution of polymorphisms between the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Carriers of risk allele G for PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP showed a lower mean value of serum triglycerides and a higher liver stiffness. Risk allele for KLF6 rs3750861 and SOD2 rs4880 polymorphism had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value, whereas no differences in the glucose and glycated hemoglobin level were observed in the subgroups by the different genotypes. Genetic polymorphisms are useful to identify the patients at higher risk of development of liver fibrosis and lower eGFR values in the patients with diabetes and NAFLD. Their use in clinical practice may help the clinicians to identify the patients who require a more strict follow-up program.

30028636,Loss of lipin 1-mediated phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activity in muscle leads to skeletal myopathy in mice,"Abstract:Lipin 1 regulates glycerolipid homeostasis by acting as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) enzyme in the triglyceride-synthesis pathway and by regulating transcription factor activity. Mutations in human lipin 1 are a common cause of recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children. Mice with constitutive whole-body lipin 1 deficiency have been used to examine mechanisms connecting lipin 1 deficiency to myocyte injury. However, that mouse model is confounded by lipodystrophy not phenocopied in people. Herein, 2 muscle-specific mouse models were studied: 1) Lpin1 exon 3 and 4 deletion, resulting in a hypomorphic protein without PAP activity, but which preserved transcriptional coregulatory function; and 2) Lpin1 exon 7 deletion, resulting in total protein loss. In both models, skeletal muscles exhibited a chronic myopathy with ongoing muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration and accumulation of phosphatidic acid and, paradoxically, diacylglycerol. Additionally, lipin 1-deficient mice had abundant, but abnormal, mitochondria likely because of impaired autophagy. Finally, these mice exhibited increased plasma creatine kinase following exhaustive exercise when unfed. These data suggest that mice lacking lipin 1-mediated PAP activity in skeletal muscle may serve as a model for determining the mechanisms by which lipin 1 deficiency leads to myocyte injury and for testing potential therapeutic approaches.-Schweitzer, G.

23139221,Ethanol administration exacerbates the abnormalities in hepatic lipid oxidation in genetically obese mice,"Abstract:Alcohol consumption synergistically increases the risk and severity of liver damage in obese patients. To gain insight into cellular or molecular mechanisms underlying the development of fatty liver caused by ethanol-obesity synergism, we have carried out animal experiments that examine the effects of ethanol administration in genetically obese mice. Lean wild-type (WT) and obese (ob/ob) mice were subjected to ethanol feeding for 4 wk using a modified Lieber-DeCarli diet. After ethanol feeding, the ob/ob mice displayed much more pronounced changes in terms of liver steatosis and elevated plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, indicators of liver injury, compared with control mice. Mechanistic studies showed that ethanol feeding augmented the impairment of hepatic sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling in the ob/ob mice. Moreover, the impairment of SIRT1-AMPK signaling was closely associated with altered hepatic functional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-α and lipin-1, two vital downstream lipid regulators, which ultimately contributed to aggravated fatty liver observed in ethanol-fed ob/ob mice. Taken together, our novel findings suggest that ethanol administration to obese mice exacerbates fatty liver via impairment of the hepatic lipid metabolism pathways mediated largely by a central signaling system, the SIRT1-AMPK axis."
29530978,Elucidation of the 14-3-3ζ interactome reveals critical roles of RNA-splicing factors during adipogenesis,"Abstract:Adipogenesis involves a complex signaling network requiring strict temporal and spatial organization of effector molecules. Molecular scaffolds, such as 14-3-3 proteins, facilitate such organization, and we have previously identified 14-3-3ζ as an essential scaffold in adipocyte differentiation. The interactome of 14-3-3ζ is large and diverse, and it is possible that novel adipogenic factors may be present within it, but this possibility has not yet been tested. Herein, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts from mice overexpressing a tandem affinity purification (TAP) epitope-tagged 14-3-3ζ molecule. After inducing adipogenesis, TAP-14-3-3ζ complexes were purified, followed by MS analysis to determine the 14-3-3ζ interactome. We observed more than 100 proteins that were unique to adipocyte differentiation, 56 of which were novel interacting partners. Among these, we were able to identify previously established regulators of adipogenesis (i.e. Ptrf/Cavin1) within the 14-3-3ζ interactome, confirming the utility of this approach to detect adipogenic factors. We found that proteins related to RNA metabolism, processing, and splicing were enriched in the interactome. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that 14-3-3ζ depletion in 3T3-L1 cells affected alternative splicing of mRNA during adipocyte differentiation. siRNA-mediated depletion of RNA-splicing factors within the 14-3-3ζ interactome, that is, of Hnrpf, Hnrpk, Ddx6, and Sfpq, revealed that they have essential roles in adipogenesis and in the alternative splicing of Pparg and the adipogenesis-associated gene Lpin1 In summary, we have identified novel adipogenic factors within the 14-3-3ζ interactome. Further characterization of additional proteins within the 14-3-3ζ interactome may help identify novel targets to block obesity-associated expansion of adipose tissues.

19281795,"A Jak2 inhibitor, AG490, reverses lipin-1 suppression by TNF-alpha in 3T3-L1 adipocytes","Abstract:Lipin-1 is a multifunctional metabolic regulator, involving in triacylglycerol and bioactive glycerolipids synthesis as an enzyme, transcriptional regulation as a coactivator, and adipogenesis. In obesity, adipose lipin-1 expression is decreased. Although lipin-1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity, the mechanism is still not clear. Since TNF-alpha is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, here we investigated the role of TNF-alpha on lipin-1 expression in adipocytes. Quantitative PCR studies showed that TNF-alpha suppressed both lipin-1A and -1B isoform expression in time- and dose-dependent manners in mature 3T3-L1 adpocytes. A Jak2 inhibitor, AG490, reversed the suppressive effect of TNF-alpha on both lipin-1A and -1B. In contrast, NF-kappaB, MAPKs, ceramide, and beta-catenin pathway tested were not involved in the mechanism. These results suggest that TNF-alpha could be involved in obesity-induced lipin-1 suppression in adipocytes and Jak2 may play an important role in the mechanism."
33297965,Hepatic transcriptome and DNA methylation patterns following perinatal and chronic BPS exposure in male mice,"Abstract                        Background:                    Bisphenol S (BPS) is a common bisphenol A (BPA) substitute, since BPA is virtually banned worldwide. However, BPS and BPA have both endocrine disrupting properties. Their effects appear mostly in adulthood following perinatal exposures. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of perinatal and chronic exposure to BPS at the low dose of 1.5 μg/kg body weight/day on the transcriptome and methylome of the liver in 23 weeks-old C57BL6/J male mice.              Results:                    This multi-omic study highlights a major impact of BPS on gene expression (374 significant deregulated genes) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis show an enrichment focused on several biological pathways related to metabolic liver regulation. BPS exposure also induces a hypomethylation in 58.5% of the differentially methylated regions (DMR). Systematic connections were not found between gene expression and methylation profile excepted for 18 genes, including 4 genes involved in lipid metabolism pathways (Fasn, Hmgcr, Elovl6, Lpin1), which were downregulated and featured differentially methylated CpGs in their exons or introns.              Conclusions:                    This descriptive study shows an impact of BPS on biological pathways mainly related to an integrative disruption of metabolism (energy metabolism, detoxification, protein and steroid metabolism) and, like most high-throughput studies, contributes to the identification of potential exposure biomarkers.

19254569,"TORC2 regulates hepatic insulin signaling via a mammalian phosphatidic acid phosphatase, LIPIN1","Abstract:TORC2 is a major transcriptional coactivator for hepatic glucose production. Insulin impedes gluconeogenesis by inhibiting TORC2 via SIK2-dependent phosphorylation at Ser171. Interruption of this process greatly perturbs hepatic glucose metabolism, thus promoting hyperglycemia in rodents. Here, we show that hyperactivation of TORC2 would exacerbate insulin resistance by enhancing expression of LIPIN1, a mammalian phosphatidic acid phosphatase for diacylglycerol (DAG) synthesis. Diet-induced or genetic obesity increases LIPIN1 expression in mouse liver, and TORC2 is responsible for its transcriptional activation. While overexpression of LIPIN1 disturbs hepatic insulin signaling, knockdown of LIPIN1 ameliorates hyperglycemia and insulin resistance by reducing DAG and PKCvarepsilon activity in db/db mice. Finally, TORC2-mediated insulin resistance is partially rescued by concomitant knockdown of LIPIN1, confirming the critical role of LIPIN1 in the perturbation of hepatic insulin signaling. These data propose that dysregulation of TORC2 would further exaggerate insulin resistance and promote type 2 diabetes in a LIPIN1-dependent manner."
33629572,The utility of next-generation sequencing technologies in diagnosis of Mendelian mitochondrial diseases and reflections on clinical spectrum,"Abstract                        Objectives:                    Diagnostic process of mitochondrial disorders (MD) is challenging because of the clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity of these conditions. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology offers a high-throughput platform for nuclear MD.              Methods:                    We included 59 of 72 patients that undergone WES and targeted exome sequencing panel suspected to have potential PMDs. Patients who were included in the analysis considering the possible PMD were reviewed retrospectively and scored according to the Mitochondrial Disease Criteria Scale.              Results:                    Sixty-one percent of the patients were diagnosed with whole-exome sequencing (WES) (36/59) and 15% with targeted exome sequencing (TES) (9/59). Patients with MD-related gene defects were included in the mito group, patients without MD-related gene defects were included in the nonmito group, and patients in whom no etiological cause could be identified were included in the unknown etiology group. In 11 out of 36 patients diagnosed with WES, a TES panel was applied prior to WES. In 47 probands in 39 genes (SURF1, SDHAF1, MTO1, FBXL4, SLC25A12, GLRX5, C19oRF12, NDUFAF6, DARS2, BOLA3, SLC19A3, SCO1, HIBCH, PDHA1, PDHAX, PC, ETFA, TRMU, TUFM, NDUFS6, WWOX, UBCD TREX1, ATL1, VAC14, GFAP, PLA2G6, TPRKB, ATP8A2, PEX13, IGHMBP2, LAMB2, LPIN1, GFPT1, CLN5, DOLK) (20 mito group, 19 nonmito group) 59 variants (31 mito group, 18 nonmito group) were detected. Seven novel variants in the mito group (SLC25A12, GLRX5, DARS2, SCO1, PC, ETFA, NDUFS6), nine novel variants in the nonmito group (IVD, GCDH, COG4, VAC14, GFAP, PLA2G6, ATP8A2, PEX13, LPIN1) were detected.              Conclusions:                    We explored the feasibility of identifying pathogenic alleles using WES and TES in MD. Our results show that WES is the primary method of choice in the diagnosis of MD until at least all genes responsible for PMD are found and are highly effective in facilitating the diagnosis process.

21803291,Expression of the splicing factor gene SFRS10 is reduced in human obesity and contributes to enhanced lipogenesis,"Abstract:Alternative mRNA splicing provides transcript diversity and may contribute to human disease. We demonstrate that expression of several genes regulating RNA processing is decreased in both liver and skeletal muscle of obese humans. We evaluated a representative splicing factor, SFRS10, downregulated in both obese human liver and muscle and in high-fat-fed mice, and determined metabolic impact of reduced expression. SFRS10-specific siRNA induces lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Moreover, Sfrs10 heterozygous mice have increased hepatic lipogenic gene expression, VLDL secretion, and plasma triglycerides. We demonstrate that LPIN1, a key regulator of lipid metabolism, is a splicing target of SFRS10; reduced SFRS10 favors the lipogenic β isoform of LPIN1. Importantly, LPIN1β-specific siRNA abolished lipogenic effects of decreased SFRS10 expression. Together, our results indicate that reduced expression of SFRS10, as observed in tissues from obese humans, alters LPIN1 splicing, induces lipogenesis, and therefore contributes to metabolic phenotypes associated with obesity."
27002347,MicroRNA-26a/b and their host genes synergistically regulate triacylglycerol synthesis by targeting the INSIG1 gene,"Abstract:The microRNA-26 (miR-26) family is known to control adipogenesis in non-ruminants. The genomic loci of miR-26a and miR-26b have been localized in the introns of genes encoding for the proteins of the C-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase (CTDSP) family. Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) encodes a protein with a key role in the regulation of lipogenesis in rodent liver. In the present study, we investigated the synergistic function of the miR-26 family and their host genes in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). Downregulation of miR-26a/b and their host genes in GMEC decreased the expression of genes relate to fatty acid synthesis (PPARG, LXRA, SREBF1, FASN, ACACA, GPAM, LPIN1, DGAT1 and SCD1), triacylglycerol accumulation and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed INSIG1 as a direct target of miR-26a/b. Furthermore, inhibition of the CTDSP family also downregulated the expression of INSIG1. Taken together, our findings highlight a functional association of miR-26a/b, their host genes and INSIG1, and provide new insights into the regulatory network controlling milk fat synthesis in GMEC. The data indicate that targeting this network via nutrition might be important for regulating milk fat synthesis in ruminants.              Keywords:                    CTDSP family; INSIG1; TAG accumulation; microRNA-26."
23928362,Combination of lipid metabolism alterations and their sensitivity to inflammatory cytokines in human lipin-1-deficient myoblasts,"Abstract:Lipin-1 deficiency is associated with massive rhabdomyolysis episodes in humans, precipitated by febrile illnesses. Despite well-known roles of lipin-1 in lipid biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to rhabdomyolysis remain unknown. Here we show that primary myoblasts from lipin-1-deficient patients exhibit a dramatic decrease in LPIN1 expression and phosphatidic acid phosphatase 1 activity, and a significant accumulation of lipid droplets (LD). The expression levels of LPIN1-target genes [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors delta and alpha (PPARδ, PPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, very long (ACADVL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase IB and 2 (CPT1B and CPT2)] were not affected while lipin-2 protein level, a closely related member of the family, was increased. Microarray analysis of patients' myotubes identified 19 down-regulated and 51 up-regulated genes, indicating pleiotropic effects of lipin-1 deficiency. Special attention was paid to the up-regulated ACACB (acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta), a key enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis/oxidation balance. We demonstrated that overexpression of ACACB was associated with free fatty acid accumulation in patients' myoblasts whereas malonyl-carnitine (as a measure of malonyl-CoA) and CPT1 activity were in the normal range in basal conditions accordingly to the normal daily activity reported by the patients. Remarkably ACACB invalidation in patients' myoblasts decreased LD number and size while LPIN1 invalidation in controls induced LD accumulation. Further, pro-inflammatory treatments tumor necrosis factor alpha+Interleukin-1beta(TNF1α+IL-1ß) designed to mimic febrile illness, resulted in increased malonyl-carnitine levels, reduced CPT1 activity and enhanced LD accumulation, a phenomenon reversed by dexamethasone and TNFα or IL-1ß inhibitors. Our data suggest that the pathogenic mechanism of rhabdomyolysis in lipin-1-deficient patients combines the predisposing constitutive impairment of lipid metabolism and its exacerbation by pro-inflammatory cytokines.

25722343,Liver-specific loss of lipin-1-mediated phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity does not mitigate intrahepatic TG accumulation in mice,"Abstract:Lipin proteins (lipin 1, 2, and 3) regulate glycerolipid homeostasis by acting as phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) enzymes in the TG synthesis pathway and by regulating DNA-bound transcription factors to control gene transcription. Hepatic PAP activity could contribute to hepatic fat accumulation in response to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. To examine the role of lipin 1 in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism, we generated mice that are deficient in lipin-1-encoded PAP activity in a liver-specific manner (Alb-Lpin1(-/-) mice). This allele of lipin 1 was still able to transcriptionally regulate the expression of its target genes encoding fatty acid oxidation enzymes, and the expression of these genes was not affected in Alb-Lpin1(-/-) mouse liver. Hepatic PAP activity was significantly reduced in mice with liver-specific lipin 1 deficiency. However, hepatocytes from Alb-Lpin1(-/-) mice had normal rates of TG synthesis, and steady-state hepatic TG levels were unaffected under fed and fasted conditions. Furthermore, Alb-Lpin1(-/-) mice were not protected from intrahepatic accumulation of diacylglycerol and TG after chronic feeding of a diet rich in fat and fructose. Collectively, these data demonstrate that marked deficits in hepatic PAP activity do not impair TG synthesis and accumulation under acute or chronic conditions of lipid overload.

29870742,Hepatic Knockdown of Splicing Regulator Slu7 Ameliorates Inflammation and Attenuates Liver Injury in Ethanol-Fed Mice,"Abstract:Aberrant precursor mRNA splicing plays a pivotal role in liver diseases. However, roles of splicing regulators in alcoholic liver disease are unknown. Herein, we investigated a splicing regulator, Slu7, in the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis. Adenovirus-mediated alteration of hepatic Slu7 expression in mice pair fed either with or without (as control) ethanol in their diet was used. Knockdown of hepatic Slu7 by adenovirus-Slu7shRNA treatment ameliorated inflammation and attenuated liver injury in mice after ethanol administration. Mechanistically, reducing liver Slu7 expression increased the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) full-length and repressed the splicing of SIRT1 into SIRT1-ΔExon8 isoform in ethanol-fed mice. Knockdown of hepatic Slu7 in the ethanol-fed mice also ameliorated splicing of lipin-1 and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3). In concordance with ameliorated splicing of SIRT1, lipin-1, and Srsf3, knockdown of hepatic Slu7 inhibited the activity of NF-κB, normalized iron and zinc homeostasis, reduced oxidative stress, and attenuated liver damage in ethanol-fed mice. In addition, hepatic Slu7 was significantly elevated in patients with alcoholic steatohepatitis. Our present study illustrates a novel role of Slu7 in alcoholic liver injury and suggests that dysregulated Slu7 may contribute to the pathogenesis of human alcoholic steatohepatitis."
28831970,Characterisation of gene expression related to milk fat synthesis in the mammary tissue of lactating yaks,"Abstract:This research communication describes the profile of gene expression related to the synthesis of yak milk as determined via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Significant up-regulation during lactation were observed in genes related to fatty acid (FA) uptake from blood (LPL, CD36), intracellular FA transport (FABP3), intracellular FA activation of long- and short-chain FAs (ACSS1, ACSS2, ACSL1), de novo synthesis (ACACA), desaturation (SCD), triacyglycerol (TAG) synthesis (AGPAT6, GPAM, LPIN1), lipid droplet formation (PLIN2, BTN1A1, XDH), ketone body utilisation (BDH1, OXCT1), and transcription regulation (THRSP, PPARGC1A). In particular, intracellular de novo FA synthesis (ACSS2, ACACA, and FABP3) and TAG synthesis (GPAM, AGPAT6, and LPIN1), whose regulation might be orchestrated as part of the gene network under the control of SERBF1 in the milk fat synthesis process, were more activated compared to levels in dairy cows. However, the genes involved in lipid droplet formation (PLIN2, XDH, and BTN1A1) were expressed at lower levels compared to those in dairy cows, where these genes are mainly controlled by the PPARG regulator.

27725442,Liver-Specific Silencing of Lipin1 Reduces Fat Mass as Well as Hepatic Triglyceride Biosynthesis in Mice,"Abstract:Lipin1, a bifunctional protein, regulates fatty acid utilization in the triglyceride biosynthesis pathway. In the current study, using a liver-specific in vivo short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery system, we examined the pathological and physiological roles of hepatic Lipin1 in the development of insulin resistance and the maintenance of systemic energy homeostasis. Liver-specific silencing of Lipin1 expression was achieved by the systemic administration of siRNA against Lpin1 mRNA (siLpin1)-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to wild type mice at 3-4 d intervals for 25 d. The siLpin1-treated mice showed normal blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity, however, triglyceride (TG) levels were reduced in liver and peripheral blood of them. The knockdown of hepatic Lipin1 in mice led to marked decrease in adipose tissue mass and adipocyte diameters in epididymal and inguinal fat depots without the undesired silencing of Lipin1 in adipose tissue. In summary, we report for the first time that the down-regulation of hepatic Lipin1 expression leads to less adiposity as well as a decrease in TG level in the liver and blood circulation, without any alterations in the glucose tolerance and blood glucose levels. Our findings may provide new insights into the physiological roles of hepatic Lipin1 in systemic energy homeostasis."
24345846,A 4-polymorphism risk score predicts steatohepatitis in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Abstract                        Objective:                    Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized countries in adults and children, following the trail of the epidemic diffusion of obesity. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a potentially serious form of NAFLD linked with a significant increase in overall and liver-related morbidity and mortality. Because diagnosis still requires liver biopsy, there is urgent need of developing noninvasive early markers. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the simultaneous detection of genetic risk factors could predict NASH.              Method:                    We enrolled 152 untreated, consecutive obese children and adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD and increased liver enzymes. The PNPLA3 rs738409 C>G (I148 M), SOD2 rs4880 C>T, KLF6 rs3750861 G>A, and LPIN1 rs13412852 C>T polymorphisms were detected by Taqman assays.              Results:                    A multivariate logistic model based on the genetic risk factors significantly predicted NASH (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.82, P < 0.0001), performing better than a clinical risk score identified at stepwise regression based on age, aspartate aminotransferase levels, and diastolic blood pressure (AUC 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.75). A single cutoff value of the genetic risk score had 90% sensitivity and 36% specificity for NASH. A risk score combining the clinical and genetic risk factors resulted in an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.73-0.87).              Conclusions:                    A score based on genetic risk factors significantly predicts NASH in obese children with increased liver enzymes, representing a proof-of-principle that genetic scores may be useful to predict long-term outcomes of the disease and guide clinical management."
30861601,Mitigative effects of the bioactive flavonol fisetin on high-fat/high-sucrose induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in rats,"Abstract                        Background:                    Worldwide growing rates of obesity are correlated with the rising prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with limited available therapeutics.              Aim:                    The present study was undertaken to investigate the modulatory effects of dietary supplementation fisetin on hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4α) gene expression, hepatic lipin-1 signaling, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) levels, poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity, as well as some oxidative stress parameters in a rat model of high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) induced NAFLD.              Methods:                    Sixty male albino rats were allocated into four equal groups: normal control group, fisetin-treated control group, NAFLD group, and fisetin-treated NAFLD group. Gene expression levels of HNF4-α were estimated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), while Lipin-1, TXNIP levels, and PARP-1 activity were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); lipid profile, hepatic lipid contents, hepatic lipoperoxides, fatty acid synthase activity, and total antioxidant capacity were also assessed colorimetrically.              Results:                    Fisetin ameliorated HFHS-induced NAFLD; where it suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation, upregulated HNF4-α /lipin-1 signaling, mitigated oxidative stress, inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated TXNIP induction, and PARP-1 activation . In conclusion, fisetin could confer protection against NAFLD and impede its progression. However,additional experimental scrutiny is needed to verify these findings.

24280072,Chronic ammonia exposure does not influence hepatic gene expression in growing pigs,"Abstract:Housed pigs are often exposed to elevated concentrations of atmospheric ammonia. This aerial pollutant is widely considered to be an environmental stressor that also predisposes to reduced growth rates and poor health, although evidence to support this view is limited. Hepatic gene expression is very responsive to stress and metabolic effects. Two batches of growing pigs were therefore exposed to a nominal concentration of atmospheric ammonia of either 5 ppm (low) or 20 ppm (high) from 4 weeks of age for 15 weeks. Growth rates were monitored. Samples of liver were taken after slaughter (at ∼19 weeks of age). Samples from the second batch were analysed for global gene expression using 23 K Affymetrix GeneChip porcine genome arrays. Samples from both batches were subsequently tested for five candidate genes using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The array analysis failed to detect any significant changes in hepatic gene expression following chronic exposure to atmospheric ammonia. Animals clustered into two main groups but this was not related to the experimental treatment. There was also no difference in growth rates between groups. The qPCR analyses validated the array results by showing similar fold changes in gene expression to the arrays. They revealed a significant batch effect in expression of lipin 1 (LPIN1), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14), serine dehydratase (SDS) and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP). Only CXCL14, a chemotactic cytokine for monocytes, was significantly down-regulated in response to ammonia. As chronic exposure to atmospheric ammonia did not have a clear influence on hepatic gene expression, this finding implies that 20 ppm of atmospheric ammonia did not pose a significant material risk to the health or metabolism of housed pigs."
25702158,Cardiac fatty acid uptake and metabolism in the rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome,"Abstract:Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with an altered plasma lipid profile and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac pathology in PCOS involve changes in expression and subcellular localization of several key proteins involved in cardiac lipid transport and metabolism, such as fatty acid transporter CD36, lipin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC1), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). We used the animal model of PCOS obtained by treating female rats with dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Protein levels of CD36, lipin 1, PPARα, PGC1, and antioxidative enzymes were assessed by Western blot in different cardiac cell compartments. Cardiac triglycerides (TG) and lipid peroxidation were also measured. The content of CD36 was decreased in both the cardiac plasma membranes and intracellular pool. On the other hand, total content of cardiac lipin 1 in DHT-treated rats was elevated, in contrast to decreased microsomal lipin 1 content. An increase in nuclear content of lipin 1 was observed together with elevation of nuclear PPARα and PGC1, and an increase in CPT1 expression. However, lipid peroxidation was reduced in the heart, without alterations in antioxidative enzymes expression and cardiac TG content. The results indicate that treatment of female rats with DHT is accompanied by a decrease of fatty acid uptake and a reduction of lipid peroxidation in the heart. The observed elevation of lipin 1, PPARα, PGC1, and CPT1 expression suggests that cardiac fatty acid metabolism is shifted toward mitochondrial beta oxidation."
25834103,Lipin-1 regulates cancer cell phenotype and is a potential target to potentiate rapamycin treatment,"Abstract:Lipogenesis inhibition was reported to induce apoptosis and repress proliferation of cancer cells while barely affecting normal cells. Lipins exhibit dual function as enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and as co-transcriptional regulators. Thus, they are able to regulate lipid homeostasis at several nodal points. Here, we show that lipin-1 is up-regulated in several cancer cell lines and overexpressed in 50 % of high grade prostate cancers. The proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cells, but not of non-tumorigenic cells, was repressed upon lipin-1 knock-down. Lipin-1 depletion also decreased cancer cell migration through RhoA activation. Lipin-1 silencing did not significantly affect global lipid synthesis but enhanced the cellular concentration of phosphatidic acid. In parallel, autophagy was induced while AKT and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation were repressed. We also observed a compensatory regulation between lipin-1 and lipin-2 and demonstrated that their co-silencing aggravates the phenotype induced by lipin-1 silencing alone. Most interestingly, lipin-1 depletion or lipins inhibition with propranolol sensitized cancer cells to rapamycin. These data indicate that lipin-1 controls main cellular processes involved in cancer progression and that its targeting, alone or in combination with other treatments, could open new avenues in anticancer therapy.

32028610,Variation in the Lipin 1 Gene Is Associated with Birth Weight and Selected Carcass Traits in New Zealand Romney Sheep,"Abstract:Lipin 1 plays an important role in lipid metabolism. In this study; we searched for variation in the ovine lipin 1 gene (LPIN1) in three gene regions (a 5' non-coding region; a region containing an alternatively spliced exon in intron 4; and a region containing coding exon 6) using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. The greatest amount of alleles was found in coding exon 6; with five sequences being detected. The effect of variation in this exon was investigated in 242 New Zealand Romney lambs derived from 12 sire-lines. The presence of variant E3 was associated with a decrease in birth weight (p = 0.005) and the proportion of leg yield (p = 0.045), but with an increase in hot carcass weight (p = 0.032) and the proportion of loin yield (p = 0.014). The presence of variant B3 was associated with an increased pre-weaning growth rate (p = 0.041), whereas the presence of variant C3 was associated with an increase in shoulder yield (p < 0.001). These results suggest that ovine LPIN1 variation may have value as a genetic marker for improving meat production and carcass traits.

34943141,Circadian Gene PER2 Silencing Downregulates PPARG and SREBF1 and Suppresses Lipid Synthesis in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells,"Abstract              PER2, a circadian clock gene, is associated with mammary gland development and lipid synthesis in rodents, partly via regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). Whether such a type of molecular link existed in bovines was unclear. We hypothesized that PER2 was associated with lipid metabolism and regulated cell cycles and apoptosis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). To test this hypothesis, BMECs isolated from three mid-lactation (average 110 d postpartum) cows were used. The transient transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to inhibit PER2 transcription in primary BMECs. The silencing of PER2 led to lower concentrations of cellular lipid droplets and triacylglycerol along with the downregulation of lipogenic-related genes such as ACACA, FASN, LPIN1, and SCD, suggesting an overall inhibition of lipogenesis and desaturation. The downregulation of PPARG and SREBF1 in response to PER2 silencing underscored the importance of circadian clock signaling and the transcriptional regulation of lipogenesis. Although the proliferation of BMECs was not influenced by PER2 silencing, the number of cells in the G2/GM phase was upregulated. PER2 silencing did not affect cell apoptosis. Overall, the data provided evidence that PER2 participated in the coordination of mammary lipid metabolism and was potentially a component of the control of lipid droplets and TAG synthesis in ruminant mammary cells. The present data suggested that such an effect could occur through direct effects on transcriptional regulators.

20977671,Drosophila melanogaster lipins are tissue-regulated and developmentally regulated and present specific subcellular distributions,"Abstract:Lipins constitute a novel family of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to yield diacylglycerol, an important intermediate in lipid metabolism and cell signaling. Whereas a single lipin is detected in less complex organisms, in mammals there are distinct lipin isoforms and paralogs that are differentially expressed among tissues. Compatible with organism tissue complexity, we show that the single Drosophila Lpin1 ortholog (CG8709, here named DmLpin) expresses at least three isoforms (DmLpinA, DmLpinK and DmLpinJ) in a temporal and spatially regulated manner. The highest levels of lipin in the fat body, where DmLpinA and DmLpinK are expressed, correlate with the highest levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) measured in this tissue. DmLpinK is the most abundant isoform in the central nervous system, where TAG levels are significantly lower than in the fat body. In the testis, where TAG levels are even lower, DmLpinJ is the predominant isoform. Together, these data suggest that DmLpinA might be the isoform that is mainly involved in TAG production, and that DmLpinK and DmLpinJ could perform other cellular functions. In addition, we demonstrate by immunofluorescence that lipins are most strongly labeled in the perinuclear region of the fat body and ventral ganglion cells. In visceral muscles of the larval midgut and adult testis, lipins present a sarcomeric distribution. In the ovary chamber, the lipin signal is concentrated in the internal rim of the ring canal. These specific subcellular localizations of the Drosophila lipins provide the basis for future investigations on putative novel cellular functions of this protein family."
18362392,Regulation of lipin-1 gene expression by glucocorticoids during adipogenesis,"Abstract:Lipin-1 deficiency in the mouse causes generalized lipodystrophy, characterized by impaired adipose tissue development and insulin resistance. Lipin-1 expression in differentiating preadipocytes is required for normal expression of adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, and for the synthesis of triacylglycerol. The requirement of lipin-1 for adipocyte differentiation can be explained, in part, by its activity as the sole adipocyte phosphatidic acid phosphatase-1 enzyme, which converts phosphatidate to diacylglycerol, the immediate precursor of triacylglycerol. Here we identify glucocorticoids as the stimulus for the induction of lipin-1 expression in differentiating adipocytes, and characterize a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in the Lpin1 promoter. The Lpin1 GRE binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and leads to transcriptional activation in adipocytes and hepatocytes, as demonstrated by reporter gene transcription, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. This represents the first gene regulatory element identified to directly influence lipin-1 expression levels, and may modulate lipin-1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue and liver in conditions associated with increased local glucocorticoid concentrations in vivo, such as obesity and fasting."
19955570,Insulin-stimulated interaction with 14-3-3 promotes cytoplasmic localization of lipin-1 in adipocytes,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a bifunctional protein involved in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Lipin-1 plays a role in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol through its phosphatidate phosphatase activity and also acts as a transcriptional co-activator of genes involved in oxidative metabolism. Lipin-1 resides in the cytoplasm and translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to catalyze the phosphatidate phosphatase reaction. It also possesses a nuclear localization signal, which is required for its translocation to the nucleus and may therefore be important for lipin-1 co-activator function. Thus, subcellular localization may be an important factor in the regulation of this protein. Here, we show that the nuclear localization signal alone is not sufficient for lipin-1 nuclear localization, and identify lipin-1 interaction with 14-3-3 as a determinant of its subcellular localization. We demonstrate that lipin-1 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and that overexpression of 14-3-3 promotes the cytoplasmic localization of lipin-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The effect of 14-3-3 is mediated through a serine-rich domain in lipin-1. Functional mapping of the 14-3-3-interacting region within the serine-rich domain indicates redundancy and cooperativity among several sites, including five phosphorylated serine and threonine residues. Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in increased lipin-1 phosphorylation, enhanced interaction with 14-3-3, and predominantly cytoplasmic localization. In summary, our studies suggest that insulin may modulate the cellular function of lipin-1 by regulating its subcellular localization through interactions with 14-3-3 proteins."
22058427,Relationship of glucose and oleate metabolism to cardiac function in lipin-1 deficient (fld) mice,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is the major phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) in the heart and a transcriptional coactivator that regulates fatty acid (FA) oxidation in the liver. As the control of FA metabolism is essential for maintaining cardiac function, we investigated whether lipin-1 deficiency affects cardiac metabolism and performance. Cardiac PAP activity in lipin-1 deficient [fatty liver dystrophy (fld)] mice was decreased by >80% compared with controls. Surprisingly, oleate oxidation and incorporation in triacylglycerol (TG), as well as glucose oxidation, were not significantly different in perfused working fld hearts. Despite this, [³H]oleate accumulation in phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol was increased in fld hearts, reflecting the decreased PAP activity. Phosphatidate accumulation was linked to increased cardiac mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Transthoracic echocardiography showed decreased cardiac function in fld mice; however, cardiac dysfunction was not observed in ex vivo perfused working fld hearts. This showed that changes in systemic factors due to the global absence of lipin-1 could contribute to the decreased cardiac function in vivo. Collectively, this study shows that fld hearts exhibit unchanged oleate esterification, as well as oleate and glucose oxidation, despite the absence of lipin-1. However, lipin-1 deficiency increases the accumulation of newly synthesized phosphatidate and induces aberrant cell signaling."
33813326,Expression analysis of genes related to lipid metabolism in peripheral blood lymphocytes of chickens challenged with reticuloendotheliosis virus,"Abstract:The underlying molecular mechanism of lipid metabolism in peripheral blood lymphocytes from chicken infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) remains poorly understood. Therefore, this scientific question was explored in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that triglyceride content was significantly reduced, but the free fatty acid content and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity were significantly increased in blood lymphocytes after REV infection. By RNA sequencing, 97 known differentially expressed genes (DEG) related to lipid metabolism or glycometabolism were screened via Gene Ontology term analysis. On the basis of these 97 DEG, enriched pathways, including the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, were identified. Among these 97 DEG, some representative genes were related to lipolysis and fatty acid utilization (PPARG, LPL, PLIN2, ACOX1, ACSL1, FABP3, and FABP4). However, other genes related to lipid biosynthesis (ACSL3, ACSL6, DGAT2, LPIN1, and LPIN2) were downregulated. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction results confirmed the accuracy of the RNA sequencing data, and the in vivo outcome supports theses in vitro results. Our findings revealed that REV regulates fatty acid and lipid metabolism in peripheral blood lymphocytes from chicken. After the lymphocytes were infected with REV, the exogenous fatty acids were preferentially used; genes involved in fatty acid utilization were upregulated via the PPAR pathway, whereas genes involved in lipid and fatty acid biosynthesis were downregulated.              Keywords:                    REV; chicken; gene expression; lipid and fatty acid metabolism; lymphocyte."
18437145,Association of a polymorphism in the lipin 1 gene with systolic blood pressure in men,"Abstract                        Background:                    Lipin 1 plays a role in abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertriglyceridemia. The gene is located at 2p25.1, a susceptibility locus for hypertension. We studied the association of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lipin 1 (LPIN1) gene with hypertension and blood pressure.              Methods:                    Twelve tagging SNPs from the HapMap database were genotyped using Sequenom MassArray in 268 hypertensive subjects and 407 normotensive controls, of whom 268 matched the cases in age and sex.              Results:                    None of the tagging SNPs were found to be associated with hypertension after correcting for multiple testing, although carriers of the minor allele of rs10520097 had nominally lower odds for hypertension (P = 0.014). After excluding subjects who were on antihypertensive medications, the minor allele of rs10495584 was nominally associated with lower mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures in men (121.1 +/- 14.2 and 76.3 +/- 10.2 mm Hg vs. 127.4 +/- 15.2 and 80.1 +/- 10.5 mm Hg, P = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively), but not in women (P > 0.05). The association of rs10495584 with systolic blood pressure in men remained significant after correcting for multiple testing and adjustment for age, waist circumference, insulin resistance, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (beta = -0.158, P = 0.005). An analysis of statistically similar SNPs (ssSNPs) in the regions surrounding rs10495584 suggested that its effect may be caused by its high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the SNP, rs11524, in which the major allele forms an exonic splicing silencer sequence.              Conclusion:                    Our study provides further evidence that lipin 1 may play a role in blood pressure regulation, especially in men."
29152100,Differential regulation of mRNAs and lncRNAs related to lipid metabolism in two pig breeds,"Abstract:Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. However, there is little research on the role of lncRNAs in fat deposition in pig. In this study, RNA-seq technology was used to analyze the gene expression profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue in Laiwu (LW) and Large White (LY) pigs. Then, key lncRNAs and genes associated with lipid metabolism and adipogenic differentiation were identified. Fifty four lncRNAs and 482 known mRNAs were differentially expressed in the two pig breeds. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analyses revealed that differentially expressed genes and the target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs were significantly enriched in PPAR signaling pathway and biological processes including fat cell differentiation and fatty acid metabolism. Key lncRNAs might regulate adipogenic differentiation and fatty acid metabolism by regulating genes involved in above signaling pathway and biological processes. Specifically, XLOC_014379, XLOC_011279, XLOC_064871, XLOC_019518 and XLOC_013639 might target SCD, LPIN1, TRIB3, EGR2 and FABP3, respectively, and then play critical regulatory role. These results are useful for understanding fat deposition in pig, breeding livestock with high quality meat, and preventing and treating lipid metabolic disease.              Keywords:                    RNA-seq; fat deposition; lncRNA; pig; subcutaneous adipose tissue."
20064776,Persistent organic pollutant exposure leads to insulin resistance syndrome,"Abstract                        Background:                    The incidence of the insulin resistance syndrome has increased at an alarming rate worldwide, creating a serious challenge to public health care in the 21st century. Recently, epidemiological studies have associated the prevalence of type 2 diabetes with elevated body burdens of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, experimental evidence demonstrating a causal link between POPs and the development of insulin resistance is lacking.              Objective:                    We investigated whether exposure to POPs contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders.              Methods:                    Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 28 days to lipophilic POPs through the consumption of a high-fat diet containing either refined or crude fish oil obtained from farmed Atlantic salmon. In addition, differentiated adipocytes were exposed to several POP mixtures that mimicked the relative abundance of organic pollutants present in crude salmon oil. We measured body weight, whole-body insulin sensitivity, POP accumulation, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and gene expression and we performed microarray analysis.              Results:                    Adult male rats exposed to crude, but not refined, salmon oil developed insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, and hepatosteatosis. The contribution of POPs to insulin resistance was confirmed in cultured adipocytes where POPs, especially organochlorine pesticides, led to robust inhibition of insulin action. Moreover, POPs induced down-regulation of insulin-induced gene-1 (Insig-1) and Lpin1, two master regulators of lipid homeostasis.              Conclusion:                    Our findings provide evidence that exposure to POPs commonly present in food chains leads to insulin resistance and associated metabolic disorders."
31970786,Expression and clinicopathological significance of lipin-1 in human breast cancer and its association with p53 tumor suppressor gene,"Abstract:Breast cancer (BC) is an important cause of female cancer-related death. It has recently been demonstrated that metabolic disorders including lipid metabolism are a hallmark of cancer cells. Lipin-1 is an enzyme that displays phosphatidate phosphatase activity and regulates the rate-limiting step in the pathway of triglycerides and phospholipids synthesis. The objective of this study was to evaluate lipin-1 expression, its prognostic significance, and its correlation with p53 tumor suppressor in patients with BC. In this study, 55 pairs of fresh samples of BC and adjacent noncancerous tissue were used to analyze lipin-1, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. The expression of other clinicopathological variables and p53 was also examined using IHC technique. The cell migration was studied in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells following the inhibition of lipin-1 by propranolol. Our results show that the relative expression of lipin-1 messenger RNA was significantly higher in BC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissue and its inhibition reduced cell migration in cancer cells. This upregulation was negatively correlated with histological grade of tumor and p53 status (p = .001 and p = .034) respectively and positively correlated with the tumor size (p = .006). Our results also seem to indicate that the high lipin-1 expression is related to a good prognosis in patients with BC. The expression of lipin-1 may be considered as a novel independent prognostic factor. The inhibition of lipin-1 may also have therapeutic significance for patients with BC. The correlation between lipin-1 and p53 confirms the role of p53 in the regulation of lipid metabolism in cancer cells.              Keywords:                    breast cancer; lipin-1; p53 tumor suppressor."
28123341,Downregulation of lipin-1 induces insulin resistance by increasing intracellular ceramide accumulation in C2C12 myotubes,"Abstract:Dysregulation of lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle is involved in the development of insulin resistance. Mutations in lipin-1, a key lipid metabolism regulator leads to significant systemic insulin resistance in fld mice. However, the function of lipin-1 on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle is still unclear. Herein we demonstrated that downregulation of lipin-1 in C2C12 myotubes by siRNA transfection suppressed insulin action, characterized by reduced insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake. Correspondingly, decreased lipin-1 expression was observed in palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes, suggested that lipin-1 might play a role in the etiology of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. The insulin resistance induced by lipin-1 downregulation was related to the disturbance of lipid homeostasis. Lipin-1 silencing reduced intracellular DAG and TAG levels, but elevated ceramide accumulation in C2C12 myotubes. Moreover, the impaired insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake caused by lipin-1 silencing could be blocked by the pretreatment with SPT inhibitor myriocin, ceramide synthase inhibitor FB1, or PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid, suggested that the increased ceramide accumulation might be responsible for the development of insulin resistance induced by lipin-1 silencing in C2C12 myotubes. Meanwhile, decreased lipin-1 expression also impaired mitochondrial function in C2C12 myotubes. Therefore, our study suggests that lipin-1 plays an important role in lipid metabolism and downregulation of lipin-1 induces insulin resistance by increasing intracellular ceramide accumulation in C2C12 myotubes. These results offer a molecular insight into the role of lipin-1 in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.

30902099,Adenovirus type 36 regulates adipose stem cell differentiation and glucolipid metabolism through the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1/PPARγ signaling pathway,"Abstract                        Background:                    This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of Adenovirus type 36 (Ad36) in adipocyte differentiation and glucolipid metabolism.              Methods:                    Rat obesity model was established by Ad36 infection and high-fat diet, respectively. Comparison of the body weight, clinical biochemical indicators, insulin sensitivity and lipid heterotopic deposition between these two models was performed. Ad36-induced adipocyte in vitro model was also established. The binding rate of FoxO1, PPARγ and its target gene promoter was detected using ChIP. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PPARγ and downstream target genes were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Oil red O staining was used to measure differentiation into adipocyte. Wortmannin (WM), inhibitor of PI3K, was used to act on Ad36-induced hADSCs.              Results:                    Ad36-induced obese rats did not exhibit disorders in blood glucose and blood TG, insulin resistance and lipid ectopic deposition. The expression of Adipoq, Lpin1 and Glut4 in the adipose tissue increased. Oil red O staining showed that Ad36 induced the differentiation of hAMSCs into human adipocytes in vitro. During this process, the binding rate of FoxO1 and PPARγ promoter regions was weakened. However, the binding rate of the transcription factor PPARγ to its target genes Acc, Adipoq, Lpin1 and Glut4 was enhanced, and thus increased the protein expression of P-FoxO1, PPARγ2, ACC, LPIN1, GLUT4 and ADIPOQ. The PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin reduced the expression of P-Akt, P-FoxO1 and PPARγ2, thereby inhibiting adipogenesis of hADSC.              Conclusion:                    Ad36 may promote fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, and improve insulin sensitivity by affecting the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1/PPARγ signaling pathway.

31064776,Gene expression and DNA methylation as mechanisms of disturbed metabolism in offspring after exposure to a prenatal HF diet,"Abstract:Exposure to a prenatal high-fat (HF) diet leads to an impaired metabolic phenotype in mouse offspring. The underlying mechanisms, however, are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study investigated whether the impaired metabolic phenotype may be mediated through altered hepatic DNA methylation and gene expression. We showed that exposure to a prenatal HF diet altered the offspring's hepatic gene expression of pathways involved in lipid synthesis and uptake (SREBP), oxidative stress response [nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)], and cell proliferation. The downregulation of the SREBP pathway related to previously reported decreased hepatic lipid uptake and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in the offspring exposed to the prenatal HF diet. The upregulation of the Nrf2 pathway was associated with increased oxidative stress levels in offspring livers. The prenatal HF diet also induced hypermethylation of transcription factor (TF) binding sites upstream of lipin 1 (Lpin1), a gene involved in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, DNA methylation of Lpin1 TF binding sites correlated with mRNA expression of Lpin1 These findings suggest that the effect of a prenatal HF diet on the adult offspring's metabolic phenotype are regulated by changes in hepatic gene expression and DNA methylation.

27121709,"Deep-fried oil consumption in rats impairs glycerolipid metabolism, gut histology and microbiota structure","Abstract                        Background:                    Deep frying in oil is a popular cooking method around the world. However, the safety of deep-fried edible oil, which is ingested with fried food, is a concern, because the oil is exposed continuously to be re-used at a high temperature, leading to a number of well-known chemical reactions. Thus, this study investigates the changes in energy metabolism, colon histology and gut microbiota in rats following deep-fried oil consumption and explores the mechanisms involved in above alterations.              Methods:                    Deep-fried oil was prepared following a published method. Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8/group). Group 1: basal diet without extra oil consumption (control group); Group 2: basal diet supplemented with non-heated canola oil (NEO group); Group 3: basal diet supplemented with deep-fried canola oil (DFEO group). One point five milliliters (1.5 mL) of non-heated or heated oil were fed by oral gavage using a feeding needle once daily for 6 consecutive weeks. Effect of DFEO on rats body weight, KEGG pathway regarding lipids metabolism, gut histology and gut microbiota were analyzed using techniques of RNA sequencing, HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform, etc.              Results:                    Among the three groups, DFEO diet resulted in a lowest rat body weight. Metabolic pathway analysis showed 13 significantly enriched KEGG pathways in Control versus NEO group, and the majority of these were linked to carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolisms. Comparison of NEO group versus DFEO group, highlighted significantly enriched functional pathways were mainly associated with chronic diseases. Among them, only one metabolism pathway (i.e. glycerolipid metabolism pathway) was found to be significantly enriched, indicating that inhibition of this metabolism pathway (glycerolipid metabolism) may be a response to the reduction in energy metabolism in the rats of DFEO group. Related gene analysis indicated that the down-regulation of Lpin1 seems to be highly associated with the inhibition of glycerolipid metabolism pathway. Histological analysis of gastrointestinal tract demonstrated several changes induced by DFEO on intestinal mucosa with associated destruction of endocrine tissue and the evidence of inflammation. Microbiota data showed that rats in DFEO group had the lowest proportion of Prevotella and the highest proportion of Bacteroides among the three groups. In particular, rats in DFEO group were characterized with higher presence of Allobaculum (Firmicutes), but not in control and NEO groups.              Conclusion:                    This study investigated the negative effect of DFEO on health, in which DFEO could impair glycerolipid metabolism, destroy gut histological structure and unbalance microbiota profile. More importantly, this is the first attempt to reveal the mechanism involved in these changes, which may provide the guideline for designing health diet.

20660155,A phosphatidic acid binding/nuclear localization motif determines lipin1 function in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis,"Abstract:Lipins are phosphatidic acid phosphatases with a pivotal role in regulation of triglyceride and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Lipin1 is also an amplifier of PGC-1α, a nuclear coactivator of PPAR-α responsive gene transcription. Lipins do not contain recognized membrane-association domains, but interaction of these enzymes with cellular membranes is necessary for access to their phospholipid substrate. We identified a role for a conserved polybasic amino acid motif in an N-terminal domain previously implicated as a determinant of nuclear localization in selective binding of lipin1β to phosphatidic acid, using blot overlay assays and model bilayer membranes. Studies using lipin1β polybasic motif variants establish that this region is also critical for nuclear import and raise the possibility that nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of lipin1β is regulated by PA. We used pharmacological agents and lipin1β polybasic motif mutants to explore the role of PA-mediated membrane association and nuclear localization on lipin1β function in phospholipid metabolism and adipogenic differentiation. We identify a role for the lipin1 polybasic motif as both a lipid binding motif and a primary nuclear localization sequence. These two functions are necessary for full expression of the biological activity of the protein in intracellular lipid metabolism and transcriptional control of adipogenesis."
18269174,The role of lipin 1 in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism,"Abstract:In conditions such as obesity and lipodystrophy, insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. One factor that influences lipid homeostasis in all three of these tissues is lipin 1. Studies in mouse models and humans have established a relationship between lipin 1 levels and both triglyceride storage in adipose tissue and insulin sensitivity. Thus, lipin 1 deficiency in the mouse results in lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. In contrast, fat-specific expression of a lipin 1 transgene results in increased triglyceride storage in adipose tissue and insulin sensitivity, despite the development of obesity. In humans, lipin 1 expression levels in adipose tissue are positively correlated with insulin sensitivity, and inversely correlated with inflammatory cytokine expression and intramyocellular lipid, a key marker of insulin resistance. These data from mouse and human studies suggest a role for lipin 1 in directing lipid to the appropriate storage site in adipose tissue, thus potentially reducing lipid accumulation in tissues such as muscle and liver. The mechanism of lipin 1 action appears to be complex, with evidence for roles in triglyceride biosynthesis and in the regulation of gene expression."
32878255,Adverse Effects of Methylglyoxal on Transcriptome and Metabolic Changes in Visceral Adipose Tissue in a Prediabetic Rat Model,"Abstract:Excessive methylglyoxal (MG) production contributes to metabolic and vascular changes by increasing inflammatory processes, disturbing regulatory mechanisms and exacerbating tissue dysfunction. MG accumulation in adipocytes leads to structural and functional changes. We used transcriptome analysis to investigate the effect of MG on metabolic changes in the visceral adipose tissue of hereditary hypetriglyceridaemic rats, a non-obese model of metabolic syndrome. Compared to controls, 4-week intragastric MG administration impaired glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) and increased glycaemia (p < 0.01) and serum levels of MCP-1 and TNFα (p < 0.05), but had no effect on serum adiponectin or leptin. Adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and lipolysis were impaired (p < 0.05) in MG-treated rats. In addition, MG reduced the expression of transcription factor Nrf2 (p < 0.01), which controls antioxidant and lipogenic genes. Increased expression of Mcp-1 and TNFα (p < 0.05) together with activation of the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway can promote chronic inflammation in adipose tissue. Transcriptome network analysis revealed the over-representation of genes involved in insulin signaling (Irs1, Igf2, Ide), lipid metabolism (Nr1d1, Lpin1, Lrpap1) and angiogenesis (Dusp10, Tp53inp1).

25179821,Possible involvement of glucocorticoids in 5α-dihydrotestosterone-induced PCOS-like metabolic disturbances in the rat visceral adipose tissue,"Abstract:Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive and metabolic disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, visceral obesity and insulin resistance. We hypothesized that changes in glucocorticoid metabolism and signaling in the visceral adipose tissue may contribute to disturbances of lipid metabolism in the rat model of PCOS obtained by 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment of prepubertal female Wistar rats. The results confirmed that DHT treatment caused anovulation, obesity and dyslipidemia. Enhanced glucocorticoid prereceptor metabolism, assessed by elevated intracellular corticosterone and increased 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 mRNA and protein levels, was accompanied by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear accumulation. In concert with the increased expression of GR-regulated prolipogenic genes (lipin-1, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1, fatty acid synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), histological analyses revealed hypertrophic adipocytes. The results suggest that glucocorticoids influence lipid metabolism in the visceral adipose tissue in the way that may contribute to pathogenesis of metabolic disturbances associated with PCOS.

32944878,Targeting mTOR by CZ415 Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis via Lipin-1 in Cervical Cancer In Vitro and In Vivo,"Abstract:CZ415, a novel inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in several types of cancer. However, its biological function and underlying mechanism of action in cervical cancer (CC) have not been fully studied. Two CC cell lines (Hela and Siha) were treated with increasing concentrations of CZ415. Cell viability was tested with the CCK-8 assay, cell proliferation was determined by Edu staining and the colony formation assay, and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining. Protein expression was evaluated by western blotting. A nude mouse xenograft model was used to confirm the anti-tumor activity of CZ415 in vivo. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were performed on samples of tumor tissue. Results showed that CZ415 inhibited CC cell survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and 100 nanomolar and 48 h were the optimal conditions. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that treatment with CZ415 significantly inhibited spheroid formation, cell proliferation, and tumor growth. Further studies showed that the anti-cancer effects of CZ415 were due to an induction of apoptosis, which was accompanied by an upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 through Lipin-1. CZ415 also reduced the levels of mTOR/STAT3 expression. However, these phenotypic changes were reversed by overexpression of Lipin-1. Our results suggest that the novel mTOR inhibitor CZ415 mediates tumor malignancy via Lipin-1 and might be useful for treating CC.

24788483,Gender differences in the expression and cellular localization of lipin 1 in the hearts of fructose-fed rats,"Abstract:To give new insight to alterations of cardiac lipid metabolism accompanied by a fructose-rich diet (FRD), rats of both sexes were exposed to 10 % fructose in drinking water during 9 weeks. The protein level and subcellular localization of the main regulators of cardiac lipid metabolism, such as lipin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI), and CD36 were studied. Caloric intake in fructose-fed rats (FFR) of both sexes was increased. Circulating triacylglyceroles (TAG) and non-esterified fatty acids were increased in male FFR, while females increased visceral adiposity and blood TAG. Total expression of lipin 1 in cardiac cell lysate and its cytosolic and microsomal level were increased in the hearts of male FFR. PPARα and PGC-1α content were decreased in the nuclear extract. In addition, cardiac deposition of TAG in male FFR was elevated, as well as inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). In contrast, in female FFR, lipin 1 level was increased in nuclear extract only, while overall CPTI expression and phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine 307 were decreased. The results of our study suggest that fructose diet causes gender-dependent alterations in cardiac lipid metabolism. Potentially detrimental effects of FRD seem to be limited to male rats. Most of the observed changes might be a consequence of elevated expression and altered localization of lipin 1. Increased inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1 is possible link between cardiac lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in FFR."
22908270,Mouse lipin-1 and lipin-2 cooperate to maintain glycerolipid homeostasis in liver and aging cerebellum,"Abstract:The three lipin phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes catalyze a step in glycerolipid biosynthesis, the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol. Lipin-1 is critical for lipid synthesis and homeostasis in adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and peripheral nerves. Little is known about the physiological role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. By using lipin-2-deficient mice, we uncovered a functional relationship between lipin-1 and lipin-2 that operates in a tissue-specific and age-dependent manner. In liver, lipin-2 deficiency led to a compensatory increase in hepatic lipin-1 protein and elevated PAP activity, which maintained lipid homeostasis under basal conditions, but led to diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. As lipin-2-deficient mice aged, they developed ataxia and impaired balance. This was associated with the combination of lipin-2 deficiency and an age-dependent reduction in cerebellar lipin-1 levels, resulting in altered cerebellar phospholipid composition. Similar to patients with Majeed syndrome, lipin-2-deficient mice developed anemia, but did not show evidence of osteomyelitis, suggesting that additional environmental or genetic components contribute to the bone abnormalities observed in patients. Combined lipin-1 and lipin-2 deficiency caused embryonic lethality. Our results reveal functional interactions between members of the lipin family in vivo, and a unique role for lipin-2 in central nervous system biology that may be particularly important with advancing age. Additionally, as has been observed in mice and humans with lipin-1 deficiency, the pathophysiology in lipin-2 deficiency is associated with dysregulation of lipid intermediates."
23773625,Enhanced prereceptor glucocorticoid metabolism and lipogenesis impair insulin signaling in the liver of fructose-fed rats,"Abstract:Overconsumption of fructose, as a highly lipogenic sugar, may profoundly affect hepatic metabolism and has been associated with many components of the metabolic syndrome, particularly with insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. In this study, we proposed that high fructose diet may enhance lipogenesis and decrease insulin sensitivity in the liver through dysregulation of glucocorticoid signaling. Therefore, we examined the effects of long-term consumption of 10% fructose solution on triglyceridemia, liver histology and intracellular corticosterone level, as well as on 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD1) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) mRNA and protein levels in the rat liver. Glucocorticoid action was assessed by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and intracellular redistribution. We also analyzed the expression of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and lipin-1. The results have shown that fructose-rich diet led to increase in 11βHSD1 and H6PDH protein levels, while hepatic corticosterone concentration remained unchanged. Concomitantly, GR was increasingly accumulated in the cytoplasm, whereas its nuclear level was unchanged and accompanied by diminished PEPCK mRNA level. Elevation of lipin-1 in the liver microsomes suggested that fructose diet led to an increase in lipogenesis and consequently to hypertriglyceridemia. The observed increase of insulin receptor supstrate-1 phosphorylation on Ser(307) represents a hallmark of impaired insulin signaling in the liver of fructose-fed rat and probably is a consequence of the alterations in 11βHSD1 and lipin-1 levels. Overall, our findings suggest that fructose-rich diet may perturb hepatic prereceptor glucocorticoid metabolism and lipogenesis, resulting in hypertriglyceridemia and attenuated hepatic insulin sensitivity.

20227514,Protection from hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation by genetic ablation of 5-lipoxygenase,"Abstract:Five-lipoxygenase (5-LO) has been postulated as a pathogenic factor in liver injury. Indeed, Alox5, the gene coding for 5-LO, is heavily over-expressed in experimental liver disease, in which 5-LO inhibition consistently ameliorates hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Herein, we report the findings in mice with targeted deletion of Alox5 as a proof of concept of the role of 5-LO in liver injury. Our findings demonstrate that ablation of Alox5 in mice confers protection against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury since hepatic necroinflammation, inflammatory infiltrate, hepatocyte ballooning and serum ALT levels were significantly reduced in Alox5-deficient mice. These mice also showed a lower degree of hepatic steatosis, which affected micro- and macrosteatosis to a similar extent. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed a differential profile of hepatic gene expression in Alox5-deficient mice, with a total of 117 genes differentially expressed in these animals. Functional grouping of these genes revealed that 28 (approximately 24% of total changes) were related to the category of lipid metabolism, including the lipogenic factors Lpin1, C/EBP, Fasn, Acly and Elovl6. Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed lipid metabolism as the molecular/cellular function most affected by the loss of Alox5. These findings confirm at a genetic level that Alox5 plays a pathogenic role in the response of the liver to injury."
34693889,Selection of candidate genes for differences in fat metabolism between cattle subcutaneous and perirenal adipose tissue based on RNA-seq,"Abstract:The site of fat deposition plays an important role in meat quality and body health. Biologically, the perirenal visceral fat (PF) and back subcutaneous fat (BF) are distinct. Angus and Simmental cattle (Bos taurus) were used as models. HE staining, triglyceride assay kit and RNA-seq were used to analyze the differences in tissue morphology and lipid accumulation, co-genes, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two tissues. According to the findings, BF has a smaller cell area and greater lipid deposition ability than PF. RNA-seq generated approximately 10.99 Gb of data in each library, and 23,472 genes were identified. The genes FABP4, ADIRF, and SCD that are related to adipose deposition were highly expressed in four tissues. There were 1678 DEGs and 1955 DEGs between BF and PF in Angus and Simmental cattle respectively. Gene Ontology function analysis identified several DEGs involved in metabolism. KEGG pathway analysis showed that four pathways related to fat metabolism were enriched. In the BF, seven genes (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL2A1, RXRA, C1QTNF7, and MOGAT2) were up-regulated. Five genes (ADRB3, ABHD5, CPT1B, CD36, LPIN1) were down-regulated. This study identified candidate genes that led to differences in fat metabolism, which could be useful in cattle breeding.              Keywords:                    Cattle; DEGs; RNA-seq; adipose deposition; adipose tissue."
20064147,Identification of target genes and pathways associated with chicken microRNA miR-143,"Abstract:MicroRNA (miRNA) is a family of small regulatory RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate many biological functions including growth and development. Recently, the expression of chicken miRNA miR-143 was identified by using a deep sequencing approach. In other vertebrate species, miR-143 functions as a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and as a tumour suppressor. However, little is known about the biological function(s) of miR-143 in chickens. To study the functions of chicken miR-143, DNA microarray analysis and a dual luciferase reporter assay were employed to identify genes directly targeted by miR-143 as well as other biologically relevant genes. Microarray analysis indicated that 124 genes were differentially expressed upon in vitro anti-miR-143 treatment in embryonic chick splenocytes (P-value cutoff <0.01). Many of these genes are associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis and tumourigenesis. Six of the up-regulated genes possess at least one potential miR-143 binding site in their 3'UTRs, of these the binding sites of PYCR2, PSTPIP1 and PDCD5 were validated by an in vitro luciferase reporter assay. In addition, several potential targets with important biological functions were identified by the miRanda algorithm and experimentally confirmed. These targets include KLF5, MAP3K7, TARDBP and UBE2E3, which have conserved miR-143 binding sites across multiple vertebrate species. Potential chicken specific miR-143 target sites were also validated for LPIN1, PCK2, PYCR2, METTL14, SLC2A2 and TNFSF10. Overall, the current study suggests that miR-143 is ubiquitously expressed among tissues and is likely to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis."
26176221,A Frame-Shift Mutation in CAV1 Is Associated with a Severe Neonatal Progeroid and Lipodystrophy Syndrome,"Abstract:A 3-year-old female patient presenting with an unknown syndrome of a neonatal progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, pulmonary hypertension, cutis marmorata, feeding disorder and failure to thrive was investigated by whole-genome sequencing. This revealed a de novo, heterozygous, frame-shift mutation in the Caveolin1 gene (CAV1) (p.Phe160X). Mutations in CAV1, encoding the main component of the caveolae in plasma membranes, cause Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 3 (BSCL). Although BSCL is recessive, heterozygous carriers either show a reduced phenotype of partial lipodystrophy, pulmonary hypertension, or no phenotype. To investigate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this syndrome in more depth, we performed next generation RNA sequencing of peripheral blood, which showed several dysregulated pathways in the patient that might be related to the phenotypic progeroid features (apoptosis, DNA repair/replication, mitochondrial). Secondly, we found a significant down-regulation of known Cav1 interaction partners, verifying the dysfunction of CAV1. Other known progeroid genes and lipodystrophy genes were also dysregulated. Next, western blotting of lysates of cultured fibroblasts showed that the patient shows a significantly decreased expression of wild-type CAV1 protein, demonstrating a loss-of-function mutation, though her phenotype is more severe that other heterozygotes with similar mutations. This phenotypic variety could be explained by differences in genetic background. Indications for this are supported by additional rare variants we found in AGPAT2 and LPIN1 lipodystrophy genes. CAV1, AGPAT2 and LPIN1 all play an important role in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in adipose tissue, and the defective function in different parts of this pathway, though not all to the same extend, could contribute to a more severe lipoatrophic phenotype in this patient. In conclusion, we report, for the first time, an association of CAV1 dysfunction with a syndrome of severe premature aging and lipodystrophy. This may contribute to a better understanding of the aging process and pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to premature aging."
14522948,Local regulation of fat metabolism in peripheral nerves,"Abstract:We comprehensively analyzed gene expression during peripheral nerve development by performing microarray analyses of premyelinating, myelinating, and postmyelinating mouse sciatic nerves, and we generated a database of candidate genes to be tested in mapped peripheral neuropathies. Unexpectedly, we identified a large cluster of genes that are (1) maximally expressed only in the mature nerve, after myelination is complete, and (2) tied to the metabolism of storage (energy) lipids. Many of these late-onset genes are expressed by adipocytes, which we find constitute the bulk of the epineurial compartment of the adult nerve. However, several such genes, including SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and Lpin1, are also expressed in the endoneurium. We find that Lpin1 null mutations lead to lipoatrophy of the epineurium, and to the dysregulation of a battery of genes required for the regulation of storage lipid metabolism in both the endoneurium and peri/epineurium. Together with the observation that these mutations also result in peripheral neuropathy, our findings demonstrate a crucial role for local storage lipid metabolism in mature peripheral nerve function, and have important implications for the understanding and treatment of peripheral neuropathies that are commonly associated with metabolic diseases such as lipodystrophy and diabetes."
34481144,Appropriate leucine supplementation promotes glucose metabolism and enhances energy homeostasis in juvenile crucian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio var. CAS III),"Abstract:In order to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which leucine regulates carbohydrate metabolism and energy homeostasis, juvenile crucian carps (Carassius auratus gibelio var. CAS III) fed with a high carbohydrate diet were supplemented with different levels of dietary leucine: 0% (Leu0), 0.4% (Leu4), 0.8% (Leu8), 1.2% (Leu12), 1.6% (Leu16), 2.0% (Leu20), and 5.0% (Leu50). After 8 weeks, RNA sequencing was performed on samples collected from the Leu0, Leu8, Leu12 and Leu50 groups. Differentially expressed genes were then detected and analyzed. The results showed a total of 91.6 Gb of clean bases were generated. Moreover, a total of 1131, 5254, and 1539 DEGs were detected in Leu8, Leu12, and Leu50 compared with Leu0, respectively, encompassing 161 common DEGs. STEM analysis elucidated four significant clusters of DEGs that were associated with ""glycerophospholipid metabolism,"" ""glycerolipid metabolism,"" ""PPAR signaling pathway,"" and ""adipocytokine signaling pathway."" Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 5 (ACSL5), choline kinase beta (CHKB), cryptochrome-1 (CRY1), lon protease homolog 2, peroxisomal isoform X2 (LONP2), lipin 1 (LPIN1), membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 2 (MBOAT2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK), and uridine-cytidine kinase 2b (UCK2b) were then further investigated in all leucine treatment groups at starvation times of 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h. The results revealed that the expression levels of UCK2b and MBOAT2 were negatively correlated with the addition of leucine, whereas CHKB, LONP2, CRY1, PEPCK, and LPIN1 were positively correlated. In conclusion, dietary leucine supplementation below 1.2% enhanced carbohydrate metabolism in juvenile crucian carp fed with a high-carbohydrate diet, whereas concentrations above 2.0% is a better choice for energy homeostasis under starvation.              Keywords:                    Carassius auratus gibelio var. CAS III; Energy homeostasis; High-carbohydrate metabolism; Leucine; Transcriptome."
27666676,Myeloid Cell-Specific Lipin-1 Deficiency Stimulates Endocrine Adiponectin-FGF15 Axis and Ameliorates Ethanol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) required for the generation of diacylglycerol during glycerolipid synthesis, and exhibits dual functions in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Lipin-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In the present study, we assessed lipin-1 function in myeloid cells in ALD using a myeloid cell-specific lipin-1 knockout (mLipin-1KO) mouse model. Utilizing the Gao-binge ethanol feeding protocol, matched mLipin-1KO mice and littermate loxP control (WT) mice were pair-fed with either an ethanol-containing diet or an ethanol-free diet (control). Surprisingly, deletion of lipin-1 in myeloid cells dramatically attenuated liver inflammatory responses and ameliorated liver injury that would normally occur following the ethanol feeding protocol, but slightly exacerbated the ethanol-induced steatosis in mice. Mechanistically, myeloid cell-specific lipin-1 deficiency concomitantly increased the fat-derived adiponectin and ileum-derived fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15. In concordance with concerted elevation of circulating adiponectin and FGF15, myeloid cell-specific lipin-1 deficiency diminished hepatic nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, limited liver inflammatory responses, normalized serum levels of bile acids, and protected mice from liver damage after ethanol challenge. Our novel data demonstrate that myeloid cell-specific deletion of lipin-1 ameliorated inflammation and alcoholic hepatitis in mice via activation of endocrine adiponectin-FGF15 signaling."
27062444,Hepatic Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Signaling Contributes to Alcohol-Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Inflammation in Mice,"Abstract                        Background:                    Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling has been shown to regulate lipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Previous studies have shown that hepatic PPARγ is up-regulated in steatotic liver of both animal and human. However, the effects of hepatic PPARγ signaling on alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remain elusive.              Methods:                    To determine the role of hepatic PPARγ signaling on ALD, wild-type (WT) and hepatocyte-specific PPARγ knockdown (PPARγ∆Hep) mice were fed a modified Lieber-DeCarli alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin control liquid diet for 8 weeks to induce ALD. Blood parameters, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation were measured after 8-week alcohol feeding.              Results:                    Alcohol feeding to WT mice resulted in liver damage (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], 94.68 ± 17.05 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase [AST], 55.87 ± 11.29 U/L), which was significantly alleviated by hepatic PPARγ knockdown (ALT, 57.36 ± 14.98 U/L; AST, 38.06 ± 3.35 U/L). Alcohol feeding led to marked lipid accumulation and up-regulation of lipogenic genes including fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), lipin1 (LIPIN1), diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) in the livers of WT mice. Knockdown of hepatic PPARγ significantly alleviated alcohol-induced lipid accumulation and abolished the up-regulation of FASN, DGAT1, and DGAT2. Silencing of PPARγ in FL83B cells significantly decreased ethanol (EtOH)-, linoleic acid-, and EtOH plus linoleic acid-induced lipid accumulation. Knockdown of hepatic PPARγ also significantly reduced alcohol-induced inflammatory chemokine (monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [MCP1], keratinocyte-derived chemokine [KC], interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10]) and inflammatory infiltration (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G], and F4/80).              Conclusions:                    The results suggest that hepatic PPARγ signaling contributes to alcohol-induced liver injury by promoting hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

23028044,Cell autonomous lipin 1 function is essential for development and maintenance of white and brown adipose tissue,"Abstract:Through analysis of mice with spatially and temporally restricted inactivation of Lpin1, we characterized its cell autonomous function in both white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipocyte development and maintenance. We observed that the lipin 1 inactivation in adipocytes of aP2(Cre/+)/Lp(fEx2)(-)(3/fEx2)(-)(3) mice resulted in lipodystrophy and the presence of adipocytes with multilocular lipid droplets. We further showed that time-specific loss of lipin 1 in mature adipocytes in aP2(Cre-ERT2/+)/Lp(fEx2)(-)(3/fEx2)(-)(3) mice led to their replacement by newly formed Lpin1-positive adipocytes, thus establishing a role for lipin 1 in mature adipocyte maintenance. Importantly, we observed that the presence of newly formed Lpin1-positive adipocytes in aP2(Cre-ERT2/+)/Lp(fEx2)(-)(3/fEx2)(-)(3) mice protected these animals against WAT inflammation and hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Loss of lipin 1 also affected BAT development and function, as revealed by histological changes, defects in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), PGC-1α, and UCP1, and functionally by altered cold sensitivity. Finally, our data indicate that phosphatidic acid, which accumulates in WAT of animals lacking lipin 1 function, specifically inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes. Together, these observations firmly demonstrate a cell autonomous role of lipin 1 in WAT and BAT biology and indicate its potential as a therapeutical target for the treatment of obesity."
28049764,The SCFβ-TRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets Lipin1 for ubiquitination and degradation to promote hepatic lipogenesis,"Abstract:The SCFβ-TRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays pivotal roles in normal cellular physiology and in pathophysiological conditions. Identification of β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TRCP) substrates is therefore critical to understand SCFβ-TRCP biology and function. We used a β-TRCP-phosphodegron motif-specific antibody in a β-TRCP substrate screen coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and identified multiple β-TRCP substrates. One of these substrates was Lipin1, an enzyme and suppressor of the family of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, which activate genes encoding lipogenic factors. We showed that SCFβ-TRCP specifically interacted with and promoted the polyubiquitination of Lipin1 in a manner that required phosphorylation of Lipin1 by mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) and casein kinase I (CKI). β-TRCP depletion in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells resulted in increased Lipin1 protein abundance, suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression, and attenuation of triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, β-TRCP1 knockout mice showed increased Lipin1 protein abundance and were protected from hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Together, these data reveal a critical physiological function of β-TRCP in regulating hepatic lipid metabolic homeostasis in part through modulating Lipin1 stability."
32877766,The PNPLA3 rs738409 variant can increase the risk of liver toxicity in multiple sclerosis patients treated with beta-interferon,"Abstract                        Background:                    Liver toxicity can limit the use of interferon-beta (IFNβ), a well-established treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). Unfortunately, known risk-factors for IFNβ-associated liver toxicity are few and of limited clinical utility. Susceptibility to drug-induced toxicity is influenced by genetic factors affecting hepatic lipid metabolism and drug-metabolizing activity.              Methods:                    We designed a retrospective, multicentre study to evaluate whether specific polymorphisms in genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism are associated with a higher risk of developing IFNβ-induced hepatotoxicity. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms were examined: rs738409 C > G in PNPLA3; rs4880 C > T in SOD2; rs3750861 C > T in KLF6; rs13412852 C > T in LPIN1; rs58542926 C > T in TM6SF2. Liver toxicity was defined as a new increase of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) plasma levels above the laboratory upper normal limit after the start of IFNβ treatment.              Results:                    One-hundred-thirteen MS patients were enrolled and twenty-nine experienced liver toxicity. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the PNPLA3 variant was significantly associated with the occurrence of liver toxicity. No associations were found between other polymorphisms and liver toxicity.              Conclusions:                    The results of our exploratory study suggest that the PNPLA3 variant can help to identify those patients at higher risk of IFNβ toxicity. The stratification of the risk of liver toxicity could increase the safety of IFNβ therapy.

25140391,The mouse liver displays daily rhythms in the metabolism of phospholipids and in the activity of lipid synthesizing enzymes,"Abstract:The circadian system involves central and peripheral oscillators regulating temporally biochemical processes including lipid metabolism; their disruption leads to severe metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes, etc). Here, we investigated the temporal regulation of glycerophospholipid (GPL) synthesis in mouse liver, a well-known peripheral oscillator. Mice were synchronized to a 12:12 h light-dark (LD) cycle and then released to constant darkness with food ad libitum. Livers collected at different times exhibited a daily rhythmicity in some individual GPL content with highest levels during the subjective day. The activity of GPL-synthesizing/remodeling enzymes: phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 1 (PAP-1/lipin) and lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) also displayed significant variations, with higher levels during the subjective day and at dusk. We evaluated the temporal regulation of expression and activity of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesizing enzymes. PC is mainly synthesized through the Kennedy pathway with Choline Kinase (ChoK) as a key regulatory enzyme or through the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway. The PC/PE content ratio exhibited a daily variation with lowest levels at night, while ChoKα and PEMT mRNA expression displayed maximal levels at nocturnal phases. Our results demonstrate that mouse liver GPL metabolism oscillates rhythmically with a precise temporal control in the expression and/or activity of specific enzymes.

31255630,Contribution of a genetic risk score to clinical prediction of hepatic steatosis in obese children and adolescents,"Abstract                        Background:                    Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest liver disease in children and adolescents in Western countries. Complex traits arise from the interplay between environmental and genetic factors in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.              Aims:                    We examined the association between NAFLD and eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at genetic loci potentially associated with liver damage (GCKR, MBOAT7, GPR120), oxidative stress (SOD2), lipid metabolism (PNPLA3, TM6SF2, LPIN1, ELOVL2, FADS2, MTTP) and fibrogenesis (KLF6) in a paediatric population. A genetic risk score (GRS) was performed taking into account both these SNPs and clinical risk factors.              Methods:                    We recruited a cohort of 514 obese children and adolescents (mean age [±SD]: 11.2 ± 2.8 years, z-BMI 3.3 ± 0.8). NAFLD was identified by ultrasonography. Genotyping was performed by TaqMan-based RT-PCR system.              Results:                    The overall prevalence of NAFLD was 67.5% (347 patients). Among the eleven genotyped SNPs, the genetic variants in TM6SF2 rs58542926 (OR = 4.13, p = 0.002), GCKR rs1260326 (OR = 1.53, p = 0.003), PNPLA3 rs738409 (OR = 1.58, p = 0.004) and ELOVL2 rs2236212 (OR = 1.34, p = 0.047) were significantly associated with a higher risk of NAFLD. Addition of a 11-polymorphism GRS to established clinical risk factors significantly (albeit modestly) improved the discriminatory capability of the regression model for predicting the risk of NAFLD (with SNPs C-statistic 0.81 [95%CI 0.75-0.88] vs. 0.77 [0.70-0.84] without SNPs; p = 0.047).              Conclusions:                    NAFLD was strongly associated with three genetic variants, TM6SF2 rs58542926, PNPLA3 rs738409 and GCKR rs1260326, and more slightly with ELOVL2 rs2236212, in obese children and adolescents. Addition of a 11-polymorphism GRS to clinical risk factors improved the predictability of NAFLD.

20007851,Involvement of adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK signaling in the protective action of rosiglitazone against alcoholic fatty liver in mice,"Abstract:The development of alcoholic fatty liver is associated with reduced adipocyte-derived adiponectin levels, decreased hepatic adiponectin receptors, and deranged hepatic adiponectin signaling in animals. Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) plays a key role in the regulation of adiponectin in adipose tissue. The aim of the present study was to test the ability of rosiglitazone, a known PPAR-gamma agonist, to reverse the inhibitory effects of ethanol on adiponectin expression and its hepatic signaling, and to attenuate alcoholic liver steatosis in mice. Mice were fed modified Lieber-DeCarli ethanol-containing liquid diets for 4 wk or pair-fed control diets. Four groups of mice were given a dose of either 3 or 10 mg.kg body wt(-1).day(-1) of rosiglitazone with or without ethanol in their diets for the last 2 wk of the feeding study. Coadministration of rosiglitazone and ethanol increased the expression and circulating levels of adiponectin and enhanced the expression of hepatic adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) in mice. These increases correlated closely with the activation of a hepatic sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling system. In concordance with stimulated SIRT1-AMPK signaling, rosiglitazone administration enhanced expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes, normalized lipin 1 expression, and blocked elevated expression of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes which, in turn, led to increased fatty acid oxidation, reduced lipogenesis, and alleviation of steatosis in the livers of ethanol-fed mice. Enhanced hepatic adiponectin-SIRT1-AMPK signaling contributes, at least in part, to the protective action of rosiglitazone against alcoholic fatty liver in mice."
32110997,Identification of the Differentially Expressed Genes of Muscle Growth and Intramuscular Fat Metabolism in the Development Stage of Yellow Broilers,"Abstract:High-quality chicken meat is an important source of animal protein for humans. Gene expression profiles in breast muscle tissue were determined, aiming to explore the common regulatory genes relevant to muscle and intramuscular fat (IMF) during the developmental stage in chickens. Results show that breast muscle weight (BMW), breast meat percentage (BMP, %), and IMF (%) continuously increased with development. A total of 256 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the developmental stage were screened. Among them, some genes related to muscle fiber hypertrophy were upregulated (e.g., CSRP3, LMOD2, MUSTN1, MYBPC1), but others (e.g., ACTC1, MYL1, MYL4) were downregulated from Week 3 to Week 18. During this period, expression of some DEGs related to the cells cycle (e.g., CCNB3, CCNE2, CDC20, MCM2) changed in a way that genetically suggests possible inhibitory regulation on cells number. In addition, DEGs associated with energy metabolism (e.g., ACOT9, CETP, LPIN1, DGAT2, RBP7, FBP1, PHKA1) were found to regulate IMF deposition. Our data identified and provide new insights into the common regulatory genes related to muscle growth, cell proliferation, and energy metabolism at the developmental stage in chickens.

28696211,Rab8a Deficiency in Skeletal Muscle Causes Hyperlipidemia and Hepatosteatosis by Impairing Muscle Lipid Uptake and Storage,"Abstract:Skeletal muscle absorbs long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) that are either oxidized in mitochondria or temporarily stored as triglycerides in lipid droplets (LDs). So far, it is still not fully understood how lipid uptake and storage are regulated in muscle and whether these are important for whole-body lipid homeostasis. Here we show that the small GTPase Rab8a regulates lipid uptake and storage in skeletal muscle. Muscle-specific Rab8a deletion caused hyperlipidemia and exacerbated hepatosteatosis induced by a high-fat diet. Mechanistically, Rab8a deficiency decreased LCFA entry into skeletal muscle and inhibited LD fusion in muscle cells. Consequently, blood lipid levels were elevated and stimulated hepatic mammalian target of rapamycin, which enhanced hepatosteatosis by upregulating hepatic lipogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis. Our results demonstrate the significance of lipid uptake and storage in muscle in regulating whole-body lipid homeostasis, and they shed light on the roles of skeletal muscle in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia and hepatosteatosis."
23267081,Mice with an adipocyte-specific lipin 1 separation-of-function allele reveal unexpected roles for phosphatidic acid in metabolic regulation,"Abstract:Lipin 1 is a coregulator of DNA-bound transcription factors and a phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that catalyzes a critical step in the synthesis of glycerophospholipids. Lipin 1 is highly expressed in adipocytes, and constitutive loss of lipin 1 blocks adipocyte differentiation; however, the effects of Lpin1 deficiency in differentiated adipocytes are unknown. Here we report that adipocyte-specific Lpin1 gene recombination unexpectedly resulted in expression of a truncated lipin 1 protein lacking PAP activity but retaining transcriptional regulatory function. Loss of lipin 1-mediated PAP activity in adipocytes led to reduced glyceride synthesis and increased PA content. Characterization of the deficient mice also revealed that lipin 1 normally modulates cAMP-dependent signaling through protein kinase A to control lipolysis by metabolizing PA, which is an allosteric activator of phosphodiesterase 4 and the molecular target of rapamycin. Consistent with these findings, lipin 1 expression was significantly related to adipose tissue lipolytic rates and protein kinase A signaling in adipose tissue of obese human subjects. Taken together, our findings identify lipin 1 as a reciprocal regulator of triglyceride synthesis and hydrolysis in adipocytes, and suggest that regulation of lipolysis by lipin 1 is mediated by PA-dependent modulation of phosphodiesterase 4."
30226904,Host phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin1 is rate limiting for functional hepatitis C virus replicase complex formation,"Abstract:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection constitutes a significant health burden worldwide, because it is a major etiologic agent of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV replication cycle is closely tied to lipid metabolism and infection by this virus causes profound changes in host lipid homeostasis. We focused our attention on a phosphatidate phosphate (PAP) enzyme family (the lipin family), which mediate the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol in the cytoplasm, playing a key role in triglyceride biosynthesis and in phospholipid homeostasis. Lipins may also translocate to the nucleus to act as transcriptional regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The best-characterized member of this family is lipin1, which cooperates with lipin2 to maintain glycerophospholipid homeostasis in the liver. Lipin1-deficient cell lines were generated by RNAi to study the role of this protein in different steps of HCV replication cycle. Using surrogate models that recapitulate different aspects of HCV infection, we concluded that lipin1 is rate limiting for the generation of functional replicase complexes, in a step downstream primary translation that leads to early HCV RNA replication. Infection studies in lipin1-deficient cells overexpressing wild type or phosphatase-defective lipin1 proteins suggest that lipin1 phosphatase activity is required to support HCV infection. Finally, ultrastructural and biochemical analyses in replication-independent models suggest that lipin1 may facilitate the generation of the membranous compartment that contains functional HCV replicase complexes."
26296887,Lipin1 Regulates Skeletal Muscle Differentiation through Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) Activation and Cyclin D Complex-regulated Cell Cycle Withdrawal,"Abstract:Lipin1, an intracellular protein, plays critical roles in controlling lipid synthesis and energy metabolism through its enzymatic activity and nuclear transcriptional functions. Several mouse models of skeletal muscle wasting are associated with lipin1 mutation or altered expression. Recent human studies have suggested that children with homozygous null mutations in the LPIN1 gene suffer from rhabdomyolysis. However, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is still poorly understood. In the present study we examined whether lipin1 contributes to regulating muscle regeneration. We characterized the time course of skeletal muscle regeneration in lipin1-deficient fld mice after injury. We found that fld mice exhibited smaller regenerated muscle fiber cross-sectional areas compared with wild-type mice in response to injury. Our results from a series of in vitro experiments suggest that lipin1 is up-regulated and translocated to the nucleus during myoblast differentiation and plays a key role in myogenesis by regulating the cytosolic activation of ERK1/2 to form a complex and a downstream effector cyclin D3-mediated cell cycle withdrawal. Overall, our study reveals a previously unknown role of lipin1 in skeletal muscle regeneration and expands our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle regeneration.

20385772,Lipin 1 represses NFATc4 transcriptional activity in adipocytes to inhibit secretion of inflammatory factors,"Abstract:Lipin 1 is a bifunctional protein that regulates gene transcription and, as a Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP), is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. We describe here the functional interaction between lipin 1 and the nuclear factor of activated T cells c4 (NFATc4). Lipin 1 represses NFATc4 transcriptional activity through protein-protein interaction, and lipin 1 is present at the promoters of NFATc4 transcriptional targets in vivo. Catalytically active and inactive lipin 1 can suppress NFATc4 transcriptional activity, and this suppression may involve recruitment of histone deacetylases to target promoters. In fat pads from mice deficient for lipin 1 (fld mice) and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes depleted of lipin 1 there is increased expression of several NFAT target genes including tumor necrosis factor alpha, resistin, FABP4, and PPARgamma. Finally, both lipin 1 protein and total PAP activity are decreased with increasing adiposity in the visceral, but not subcutaneous, fat pads of ob/ob mice. These observations place lipin 1 as a potentially important link between triacylglycerol synthesis and adipose tissue inflammation."
23360819,Influence of SNPs in nutrient-sensitive candidate genes and gene-diet interactions on blood lipids: the DiOGenes study,"Abstract:Blood lipid response to a given dietary intervention could be determined by the effect of diet, gene variants or gene-diet interactions. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether variants in presumed nutrient-sensitive genes involved in lipid metabolism modified lipid profile after weight loss and in response to a given diet, among overweight European adults participating in the Diet Obesity and Genes study. By multiple linear regressions, 240 SNPs in twenty-four candidate genes were investigated for SNP main and SNP-diet interaction effects on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and TAG after an 8-week low-energy diet (only main effect) ,and a 6-month ad libitum weight maintenance diet, with different contents of dietary protein or glycaemic index. After adjusting for multiple testing, a SNP-dietary protein interaction effect on TAG was identified for lipin 1 (LPIN1) rs4315495, with a decrease in TAG of 20.26 mmol/l per A-allele/protein unit (95% CI 20.38, 20.14, P=0.000043). In conclusion, we investigated SNP-diet interactions for blood lipid profiles for 240 SNPs in twenty-four candidate genes, selected for their involvement in lipid metabolism pathways, and identified one significant interaction between LPIN1 rs4315495 and dietary protein for TAG concentration."
22231922,Expression and significance of lipin1 and AMPKα in hepatic insulin resistance in diet-induced insulin resistance rats,"Abstract                        Background:                    Lipin1, a lately indentified adipokine, may link obesity with insulin resistance and diabetes. The present study aimed to investigate the changes and significance of lipin1 expression and lipin1-AMPK signaling in diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance.              Methods:                    24 4-week-old Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) control group (CO), (2) high-fat diet group (HF). Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. The mRNA levels of α1 and α2 subunit of AMPKα as well as Lipin1 were measured using Real-time RT-PCR. The activities of AMPKα and Akt were evaluated by detection of p-AMPKα (Thr-172) and p-Akt (ser473) by Western blot.              Results:                    After treatment of 4 months, HF group showed significantly increased levels of body weight, fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels; Plasma and liver total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) levels were also markedly elevated; Lipin1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels were significantly deceased. Compared with CO group, the mRNA and protein levels of AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 were not changed, whereas the p-AMPK (Thr-172) and p-AKT (ser473) levels in liver were significantly decreased in HF group.              Conclusions:                    These findings indicated that the decrease in lipin1 expression and AMPKα activation may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance in diet-induced obese rats."
24262277,Deletion of SIRT1 from hepatocytes in mice disrupts lipin-1 signaling and aggravates alcoholic fatty liver,"Abstract                        Background & aims:                    Sirtuin (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylase that regulates hepatic lipid metabolism by modifying histones and transcription factors. Ethanol exposure disrupts SIRT1 activity and contributes to alcoholic liver disease in rodents, but the exact pathogenic mechanism is not clear. We compared mice with liver-specific deletion of Sirt1 (Sirt1LKO) mice with their LOX littermates (controls).              Methods:                    We induced alcoholic liver injury in male Sirt1LKO and control mice, placing them on Lieber-DeCarli ethanol-containing diets for 10 days and then administering a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) via gavage. Liver and serum samples were collected. We also measured messenger RNA levels of SIRT1, SFRS10, and lipin-1β and lipin-1α in liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis and individuals without alcoholic hepatitis (controls).              Results:                    On the ethanol-containing diet, livers of Sirt1LKO mice accumulated larger amounts of hepatic lipid and expressed higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than control mice; serum of Sirt1LKO mice had increased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Hepatic deletion of SIRT1 exacerbated ethanol-mediated defects in lipid metabolism, mainly by altering the function of lipin-1, a transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. In cultured mouse AML-12 hepatocytes, transgenic expression of SIRT1 prevented fat accumulation in response to ethanol exposure, largely by reversing the aberrations in lipin-1 signaling induced by ethanol. Liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis had reduced levels of SIRT1 and a higher ratio of Lpin1β/α messenger RNAs than controls.              Conclusions:                    In mice, hepatic deletion of Sirt1 promotes steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in response to ethanol challenge. Ethanol-mediated impairment of hepatic SIRT1 signaling via lipin-1 contributes to development of alcoholic steatosis and inflammation. Reagents designed to increase SIRT1 regulation of lipin-1 can be developed to treat patients with alcoholic fatty liver disease.

31927142,X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1): A key protein for renal osmotic adaptation. Its role in lipogenic program regulation,"Abstract:In renal cells, hyperosmolarity can induce cellular stress or differentiation. Both processes require active endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein synthesis. Lipid biosynthesis also occurs at ER surface. We showed that hyperosmolarity upregulates glycerophospholipid (GP) and triacylglycerol (GL-TG) de novo synthesis. Considering that massive synthesis of proteins and/or lipids may drive to ER stress, herein we evaluated whether hyperosmolar environment induces ER stress and the participation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-XBP1 in hyperosmotic-induced lipid synthesis. Treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with hyperosmolar medium triggered ER stress-associated unfolded protein response (UPR). Hyperosmolarity significantly increased xbp1 mRNA and protein as function of time; 24 h of treatment raised the spliced form of XBP1 protein (XBP1s) and induced its translocation to nuclear compartment where it can act as a transcription factor. XBP1 silencing or IRE1α ribonuclease (RNAse) inhibition impeded the expression of lipin1, lipin2 and diacylglycerol acyl transferase-1 (DGAT1) enzymes which yielded decreased GL-TG synthesis. The lack of XBP1s also decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) 1 and 2. Together our data demonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces IRE1α → XBP1s activation; XBP1s drives the expression of SREBP1 and SREBP2 which in turn regulates the expression of the lipogenic enzymes lipin1 (LPIN1) and 2 (LPIN2) and DGAT1. We also demonstrated for the first time that tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), the master regulator of osmoprotective response, regulates XBP1 expression. Thus, XBP1 acts as an osmoprotective protein since it is activated by high osmolarity and upregulates lipid metabolism, membranes generation and the restoration of ER homeostasis.              Keywords:                    ER stress; Hyperosmolarity; Lipogenic enzymes; SREBP; XBP1."
18694939,Temporal and spatial regulation of the phosphatidate phosphatases lipin 1 and 2,"Abstract:Lipins are the founding members of a novel family of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases (PAP1 enzymes) that play key roles in fat metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Despite their importance, there is still little information on how their activity is regulated. Here we demonstrate that the functions of lipin 1 and 2 are evolutionarily conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals. The two lipins display distinct intracellular localization in HeLa M cells, with a pool of lipin 2 exhibiting a tight membrane association. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of lipin 1 leads to a dramatic decrease of the cellular PAP1 activity in HeLa M cells, whereas silencing of lipin 2 leads to an increase of lipin 1 levels and PAP1 activity. Consistent with their distinct functions in HeLa M cells, lipin 1 and 2 exhibit reciprocal patterns of protein expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lipin 2 levels increase in lipin 1-depleted 3T3-L1 cells without rescuing the adipogenic defects, whereas depletion of lipin 2 does not inhibit adipogenesis. Finally, we show that the PAP1 activity of both lipins is inhibited by phosphorylation during mitosis, leading to a decrease in the cellular PAP1 activity during cell division. We propose that distinct and non-redundant functions of lipin 1 and 2 regulate lipid production during the cell cycle and adipocyte differentiation."
30277580,"Responses of MAC-T Cells to Inhibited Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 during cis-9, trans-11 Conjugated Linoleic Acid Synthesis","Abstract:Cis-9-conjugated, trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is known for its positive activities on human health. The synthesis of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in mammary glands is generally thought to be catalyzed by stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), but this has not been rigorously established. In this study, we hypothesized that the inhibition of SCD1 (by CAY10566) would block the synthesis of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in bovine mammary alveolar cells (MAC-T) cells. Results showed that MAC-T cells incubated with 10 nM CAY10566 for 12 h (CAY) produced less cis-9, trans-11 CLA (p < 0.01), lower 14:1/(14:1 + 14:0)% (p < 0.01), more trans-11 18:1 (TVA) accumulation (p < 0.01), and reduced SCD1 mRNA levels (p < 0.01) compared with the control group (CON). Moreover, the mRNA abundances of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 [SREBPF1], acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 [ACSS2], and lipin 1 [LPIN1] were significantly elevated when SCD1 was inhibited in the CAY group (p < 0.05). Taken together, CAY10566 inhibition of SCD1 resulted in lower cis-9, trans-11 CLA synthesis ability, and SREBF1, ACSSS2, and LPIN1 were negatively associated with SCD1. These findings not only provide the direct evidence that cis-9, trans-11 CLA synthesis is catalyzed by SCD1, but also help us understand the responses of MAC-T cells to SCD1 inhibition.              Keywords:                    CAY10566; MAC‐T cells; Stearoyl‐CoA desaturase 1; cis‐9; trans‐11 CLA."
18245816,"Glucocorticoids and cyclic AMP selectively increase hepatic lipin-1 expression, and insulin acts antagonistically","Abstract:Glucocorticoids (GCs) increase hepatic phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1) activity. This is important in enhancing the liver's capacity for storing fatty acids as triacylglycerols (TAGs) that can be used subsequently for beta-oxidation or VLDL secretion. PAP1 catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol, a key substrate for TAG and phospholipid biosynthesis. PAP1 enzymes in liver include lipin-1A and -1B (alternatively spliced isoforms) and two distinct gene products, lipin-2 and lipin-3. We determined the mechanisms by which the composite PAP1 activity is regulated using rat and mouse hepatocytes. Levels of lipin-1A and -1B mRNA were increased by dexamethasone (dex; a synthetic GC), and this resulted in increased lipin-1 synthesis, protein levels, and PAP1 activity. The stimulatory effect of dex on lipin-1 expression was enhanced by glucagon or cAMP and antagonized by insulin. Lipin-2 and lipin-3 mRNA were not increased by dex/cAMP, indicating that increased PAP1 activity is attributable specifically to enhanced lipin-1 expression. This work provides the first evidence for the differential regulation of lipin activities. Selective lipin-1 expression explains the GC and cAMP effects on increased hepatic PAP1 activity, which occurs in hepatic steatosis during starvation, diabetes, stress, and ethanol consumption."
31304752,Effects of Free Fatty Acids with Different Chain Lengths and Degrees of Saturability on the Milk Fat Synthesis in Primary Cultured Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells,"Abstract:How short-chain fatty acids (FAs) affect cell membrane morphology and milk fat biosynthesis in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) is yet unclear. This study investigated the primary bovine MEC response to different FAs. We observed that the cell surface ultrastructures were influenced by chain length and degree of saturability of FAs. The CD36, FATP1, and FABP3 gene expression was affected independent of the type of FA. FASN, LPIN1, PPARα, and PPARγ transcripts were more sensitive to the short-chain FAs (acetic and β-hydroxybutyric acids). Furthermore, short-chain FAs inclined to regulate FA degradation-, elongation-, and metabolism-associated pathways, while long-chain FAs (stearic and trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linolenic acids) modulated extracellular matrix-receptor interaction-, transcriptional misregulation-, microRNA-, and ribosome biogenesis-related pathways. However, triacylglycerol accumulation in the cytoplasm was not changed by all of the FAs. Overall, FAs with different chain lengths and degrees of saturability could differentially alter primary bovine MEC cell morphology and influence protein profiles involved in milk fat synthesis pathways.

28653652,Obesity- and age-related alterations in FAT/CD36 translocation and lipin-1 subcellular localization in skeletal muscle of the Zucker rats,"Abstract:Fatty acid (FA) uptake and/or intramuscular triglyceride (TG) accumulation in skeletal muscle are increased in obesity, type 2 diabetes and aging. FA translocase (FAT/CD36) translocation, lipin-1 subcellular localization and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 protein content in quadriceps muscle of young and old obese Zucker fa/fa rats and their lean controls were analyzed by immunoblot to define obesity- and aging-related alterations in FA uptake, their subsequent metabolic fate and potential to activate pro-inflammatory signaling. As expected, obesity increased FAT/CD36 content in plasma membrane in quadriceps muscle of fa/fa rats. Aging increased cytosolic lipin-1 content in both, obese rats and their lean controls. Also, old obese rats had decreased level of nuclear extract lipin-1compared to that in old lean rats. Neither obesity nor age altered NF-κB p65 protein content in cytosol and nuclear extract of quadriceps muscle suggesting that obesity/aging-induced changes in FA handling are not accompanied by NF-κB-mediated inflammation. Increase in plasma membrane FAT/CD36 content in obese rats and failure in lipin-1 export to nucleus with progression of obesity, implying an increase in FA uptake and their different channeling into lipid intermediates synthesis pathway in old fa/fa rats versus FA usage in lean rats of the same age."
17383702,Toxicogenomic evaluation of microcystin-LR treated with ultrasonic irradiation,"Abstract:Microcystins are a family of toxins produced by cyanobacteria found throughout the world in marine and freshwater environments. The most commonly encountered form of microcystin is microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Humans are exposed to MC-LR by drinking contaminated water. The toxin accumulates rapidly in the liver where it exerts most of its damage. Treatment of water containing MC-LR by ultrasonic irradiation leads to the breakdown of the toxin. Both the parent toxin and the treated toxin reaction products (TTRP) were evaluated for toxic effects in mice. Animals were exposed to purified MC-LR or an equivalent dose of the TTRP and sacrificed after 4 h or 24 h. Serum was collected and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as an indicator of hepatotoxicity. LDH activity was detected in the serum of MC-LR exposed mice indicative of liver damage, but not in control mice. Only a fraction of that activity was detectable in mice exposed to TTRP. Liver RNA was used for microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Individual animals varied in their overall genomic response to the toxin; however, only 20 genes showed consistent changes in expression. These include chaperones which may be part of a generalized stress response; cytochrome P450 which may be involved in metabolizing the toxin; and lipid dystrophy genes such as lipin-2, uridine phosphorylase and a homolog to tribbles, a stress-inducible gene involved in cell death. Of the genes that responded to the MC-LR, none showed significant changes in expression profile in response to TTRP. Taken together, the data indicate that ultrasonic irradiation of MC-LR effectively reduces hepatotoxicity in mice and therefore may be a useful method for detoxification of drinking water."
31839790,Duration of the flaxseed diet promotes deposition of n-3 fatty acids in the meat and skin of Peking ducks,"Abstract                        Background:                    Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n-3, have beneficial effects on human health, and for this reason foodstuffs with increased content of n-3 PUFA are now very common and widely available.              Design:                    This study was conducted to investigate the effect of the duration of a flaxseed diet on Peking duck's growth performance, antioxidant status, gene expression, and fatty acid profile of the meat. A total of 792 12-day-old white Peking ducks were divided into four groups. In the control group, animals were provided with a basal diet. In the three experimental groups, animals were fed a 10% flax seed diet with vitamin E at 13, 23, and 33 days of age for 30, 20, and 10 days, respectively.              Results:                    The growth performance of the ducks decreased with flaxseed diet's duration. Both body weight and body weight gain decreased linearly while Feed conversion ratios (FCR) increased in the group of ducks fed flaxseed compared to control ducks. Serum triglycerides (TG), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) linearly decreased while high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels increased by feeding flaxseed up to 30 days. The expression of lipin-1 gene (LPIN-1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) linearly increased in ducks fed flaxseed for 30 days. Linolenic acid (n-3) and its long-chain metabolites like eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and total n-3 fatty acids (FA) linearly increased while the ratio of n-6 to n-3 was reduced with increased duration of flaxseed supplementation.              Conclusion:                    Overall, we found that increasing the duration of flaxseed diet with vitamin E for more than 10 days had a mild adverse effect on duck's growth performance but enrichedits meat with long-chain PUFA and decreased the n-6 to n-3 ratio, providing quality meat for health-conscious consumers. A period of 20 days is good for producing n-3 enriched Peking duck meat and skin.              Keywords:                    DHA; FADS2; LPIN-1; duck; flaxseed; meat."

27780754,"PPARγ agonists induce adipocyte differentiation by modulating the expression of Lipin-1, which acts as a PPARγ phosphatase","Abstract:PPARγ agonists induced obesity in animal models as a side effect. Microarray experiments reveal that PPARγ agonist upregulates the expression of lipin-1 and this upregulation is correlated with the activity of the agonists. Lipin-1 induced by PPARγ agonists decreased the levels of PPARγ and ERK1/2 phosphorylation through direct interaction with these proteins in 3T3-L1 cells. In PPARγ agonist-treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the knockdown of lipin-1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited the adipogenesis that was induced by PPARγ agonists. In contrast, PPARγ2 expression was increased, and lipid droplets were accumulated in lipin-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Rosiglitazone (RGZ), a strong PPARγ agonist, synergistically promoted PPARγ dephosphorylation and adipogenesis in lipin-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Therefore, lipin-1 has dual functions as a transcriptional cofactor and phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) in the differentiation of preadipocyte cells induced by strong PPARγ agonists. In addition, the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells was markedly upregulated by diacylglycerol (DAG), which was produced by lipin-1. Therefore, lipin-1 induction by PPARγ agonists might be an important factor in understanding the biological mechanism of the agonists' adverse effects, and this information may be valuable in the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapeutics with reduced adverse effects and greater tolerability.

20110263,Profiling of promoter occupancy by PPARalpha in human hepatoma cells via ChIP-chip analysis,"Abstract:The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is an important regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. While PPARalpha is known to activate transcription of numerous genes, no comprehensive picture of PPARalpha binding to endogenous genes has yet been reported. To fill this gap, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip in combination with transcriptional profiling on HepG2 human hepatoma cells treated with the PPARalpha agonist GW7647. We found that GW7647 increased PPARalpha binding to 4220 binding regions. GW7647-induced binding regions showed a bias around the transcription start site and most contained a predicted PPAR binding motif. Several genes known to be regulated by PPARalpha, such as ACOX1, SULT2A1, ACADL, CD36, IGFBP1 and G0S2, showed GW7647-induced PPARalpha binding to their promoter. A GW7647-induced PPARalpha-binding region was also assigned to SREBP-targets HMGCS1, HMGCR, FDFT1, SC4MOL, and LPIN1, expression of which was induced by GW7647, suggesting cross-talk between PPARalpha and SREBP signaling. Our data furthermore demonstrate interaction between PPARalpha and STAT transcription factors in PPARalpha-mediated transcriptional repression, and suggest interaction between PPARalpha and TBP, and PPARalpha and C/EBPalpha in PPARalpha-mediated transcriptional activation. Overall, our analysis leads to important new insights into the mechanisms and impact of transcriptional regulation by PPARalpha in human liver and highlight the importance of cross-talk with other transcription factors."
33066354,cAMP Response Element Binding Protein 1 (CREB1) Promotes Monounsaturated Fatty Acid Synthesis and Triacylglycerol Accumulation in Goat Mammary Epithelial Cells,"Abstract:cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB1) is a member of the leucine zipper transcription factor family of DNA binding proteins. Although studies in non-ruminants have demonstrated a crucial role of CREB1 in lipid synthesis in liver and adipose tissue, it is unknown if this transcription regulator exerts control of fatty acid synthesis in ruminant mammary cells. To address this question, we first defined the expression dynamics of CREB1 in mammary tissue during lactation. Analysis of CREB1 in mammary tissue revealed higher mRNA abundance in mammary tissue harvested at peak lactation. Overexpression of CREB1 markedly upregulated sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase α (ACACA), elongase of very long chain fatty acids 6 (ELOVL6), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), lipin 1 (LPIN1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), but had no effect on glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, mitochondrial (GPAM) or 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 6 (AGPAT6). In addition, overexpressing CREB1 led to a significant increase in the concentration and desaturation index of C16:1 (palmitoleic acid) and C18:1 (oleic acid), along with increased concentration of triacylglycerol. Taken together, these results highlight an important role of CREB1 in regulating lipid synthesis in goat mammary epithelial cells. Thus, manipulation of CREB1 in vivo might be one approach to improve the quality of goat milk.

24866789,Francisella tularensis LVS induction of prostaglandin biosynthesis by infected macrophages requires specific host phospholipases and lipid phosphatases,"Abstract:Francisella tularensis induces the synthesis of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) by infected macrophages to alter host immune responses, thus providing a survival advantage to the bacterium. We previously demonstrated that PGE(2) synthesis by F. tularensis-infected macrophages requires cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA(2)), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGES1). During inducible PGE(2) synthesis, cPLA(2) hydrolyzes arachidonic acid (AA) from cellular phospholipids to be converted to PGE(2). However, in F. tularensis-infected macrophages we observed a temporal disconnect between Ser505-cPLA(2) phosphorylation (a marker of activation) and PGE(2) synthesis. These results suggested to us that cPLA(2) is not responsible for the liberation of AA to be converted into PGE(2) by F. tularensis-infected macrophages. Utilizing small-molecule inhibitors, we demonstrated that phospholipase D and diacylglycerol lipase were required for providing AA for PGE(2) biosynthesis. cPLA(2), on the other hand, was required for macrophage cytokine responses to F. tularensis. We also demonstrated for the first time that lipin-1 and PAP2a contribute to macrophage inflammation in response to F. tularensis. Our results identify both an alternative pathway for inducible PGE(2) synthesis and a role for lipid-modifying enzymes in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory function."
26950863,Ontogenetic Expression of Lpin2 and Lpin3 Genes and Their Associations with Traits in Two Breeds of Chinese Fat-tailed Sheep,"Abstract:Lipins play dual function in lipid metabolism by serving as phosphatidate phosphatase and transcriptional co-regulators of gene expression. Mammalian lipin proteins consist of lipin1, lipin2, and lipin3 and are encoded by their respective genes Lpin1, Lpin2, and Lpin3. To date, most studies are concerned with Lpin1, only a few have addressed Lpin2 and Lpin3. Ontogenetic expression of Lpin2 and Lpin3 and their associations with traits would help to explore their molecular and physiological functions in sheep. In this study, 48 animals with an equal number of males and females each for both breeds of fat-tailed sheep such as Guangling Large Tailed (GLT) and Small Tailed Han (STH) were chosen to evaluate the ontogenetic expression of Lpin2 and Lpin3 from eight different tissues and months of age by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Associations between gene expression and slaughter and tail traits were also analyzed. The results showed that Lpin2 mRNA was highly expressed in perirenal and tail fats, and was also substantially expressed in liver, kidney, reproductive organs (testis and ovary), with the lowest levels in small intestine and femoral biceps. Lpin3 mRNA was prominently expressed in liver and small intestine, and was also expressed at high levels in kidney, perirenal and tail fats as well as reproductive organs (testis and ovary), with the lowest level in femoral biceps. Global expression of Lpin2 and Lpin3 in GLT both were significantly higher than those in STH. Spatiotemporal expression showed that the highest levels of Lpin2 expression occurred at 10 months of age in two breeds of sheep, with the lowest expression at 2 months of age in STH and at 8 months of age in GLT. The greatest levels of Lpin3 expression occurred at 4 months of age in STH and at 10 months of age in GLT, with the lowest expression at 12 months of age in STH and at 8 months of age in GLT. Breed and age significantly influenced the tissue expression patterns of Lpin2 and Lpin3, respectively, and sex significantly influenced the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Lpin3. Meanwhile, Lpin2 and Lpin3 mRNA expression both showed significant correlations with slaughter and tail traits, and the associations appear to be related with the ontogenetic expression as well as the potential functions of lipin2 and lipin3 in sheep.

18769019,The level and compartmentalization of phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (lipin-1) control the assembly and secretion of hepatic VLDL,"Abstract:Phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (PAP-1) converts phosphatidate to diacylglycerol and plays a key role in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerol (TAG). PAP-1 activity is encoded by members of the lipin family, including lipin-1 (1alpha and 1beta), -2, and -3. We determined the effect of lipin-1 expression on the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) using McA-RH7777 cells. Expression of lipin-1alpha or -1beta increased the synthesis and secretion of [(3)H]glycerol-labeled lipids under either basal- or oleate-supplemented conditions. In the presence of oleate, the increased TAG secretion was mainly associated with VLDL(1) (S(f) > 100) and VLDL(2) (S(f) 20-100). Expression of lipin-1alpha or -1beta increased secretion efficiency and decreased intracellular degradation of [(35)S]apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB100). Knockdown of lipin-1 using specific short interfering RNA decreased secretion of [(3)H]glycerolipids and [(35)S]apoB100 even though total PAP-1 activity was not decreased, owing to the presence of lipin-2 and -3 in the cells. Deletion of the nuclear localization signal sequences within lipin-1alpha not only abolished nuclear localization but also resulted in impaired association with microsomal membranes. Cells expressing the cytosolic lipin-1alpha mutant failed to promote [(35)S]apoB100 synthesis or secretion, and showed compromised stimulation in [(3)H]TAG synthesis and secretion. Thus, alteration in hepatic expression of lipin-1 and its compartmentalization control VLDL assembly/secretion."
36625880,"Low-Intensity Exercise Affects Cardiac Fatty Acid Oxidation by Increasing the Nuclear Content of PPARα, FOXO1, and Lipin1 in Fructose-Fed Rats","Abstract              Background and Aim: Excessive fructose consumption along with a sedentary lifestyle provokes metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Fructose overload causes cardiac insulin resistance and increases reliance on fatty acid (FA) uptake and catabolism. The cardiometabolic benefits of exercise training have long been appreciated. The goal of the presented study is to shed a new light to the preventive role of exercise training on cardiac lipid metabolism in fructose-fed rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into control (C), sedentary fructose (F), and exercised fructose (EF) groups. Fructose was given as a 10% fructose solution in drinking water for 9 weeks. Low-intensity exercise training was applied for 9 weeks. The protein expression and subcellular localization of Lipin1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1 α (PGC1) were analyzed in the heart using Western blot. Cardiac forkhead box transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein levels were also evaluated. Gene expression of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Exercise training has augmented the expression of main regulators of FA oxidation in the heart and achieves its effect by increasing the nuclear content of PPARα, Lipin1, and FOXO1 compared with the fructose group (P = 0.0422, P = 0.000045, P = 0.00958, respectively). In addition, Lipin1, FOXO1, and SIRT1 were increased in nuclear extract after exercise compared with the control group (P = 0.000043, P = 0.0417, P = 0.0329, respectively). In cardiac lysate, low-intensity exercise caused significantly increased protein level of PPARα, PGC1, FOXO1, and SIRT1 compared with control (P = 0.0377, P = 0.0275, P = 0.0096, P = 0.0282, respectively) and PGC1 level compared with the fructose group (P = 0.0417). Conclusion: The obtained results imply that the heart with a metabolic burden additionally relies on FA as an energy substrate after low-intensity running.              Keywords:                    FOXO1; PPARα; exercise; fatty acid oxidation; fructose-rich diet; heart."
25744540,"CK1δ restrains lipin-1 induction, lipid droplet formation and cell proliferation under hypoxia by reducing HIF-1α/ARNT complex formation","Abstract:Proliferation of cells under hypoxia is facilitated by metabolic adaptation, mediated by the transcriptional activator Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1α, the inducible subunit of HIF-1 is regulated by oxygen as well as by oxygen-independent mechanisms involving phosphorylation. We have previously shown that CK1δ phosphorylates HIF-1α in its N-terminus and reduces its affinity for its heterodimerization partner ARNT. To investigate the importance of this mechanism for cell proliferation under hypoxia, we visually monitored HIF-1α interactions within the cell nucleus using the in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Both methods show that CK1δ-dependent modification of HIF-1α impairs the formation of a chromatin binding HIF-1 complex. This is confirmed by analyzing expression of lipin-1, a direct target of HIF-1 that mediates hypoxic neutral lipid accumulation. Inhibition of CK1δ increases lipid droplet formation and proliferation of both cancer and normal cells specifically under hypoxia and in an HIF-1α- and lipin-1-dependent manner. These data reveal a novel role for CK1δ in regulating lipid metabolism and, through it, cell adaptation to low oxygen conditions.               Keywords:                    CK1δ; HIF-1; Hypoxia; Lipid droplets; Lipid metabolism; Lipin1."
31223619,mTORC2 Regulates Lipogenic Gene Expression through PPAR γ to Control Lipid Synthesis in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells,"Abstract:The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) primarily functions as an effector of insulin/PI3K signaling to regulate cell proliferation and is associated with cell metabolism. However, the function of mTORC2 in lipid metabolism is not well understood. In the present study, mTORC2 was inactivated by the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 or shRNA targeting RICTOR in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (pBMECs). MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of AZD8055 on cell proliferation. ELISA assay and GC-MS analysis were used to determine the content of lipid. The mRNA and protein expression levels were investigated by RT/real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. We found that cell proliferation, mTORC2 activation, and lipid secretion were inhibited by AZD8055. RICTOR was knocked down and mTORC2 activation was specifically attenuated by the shRNA. Compared to control cells, the expression of the transcription factor gene PPARG and the lipogenic genes LPIN1, DGAT1, ACACA, and FASN was downregulated in RICTOR silencing cells. As a result, the content of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG), palmitic acid (PA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and other 16 types of fatty acid was decreased in the treated cells; the accumulation of TAG, PA, and DHA in cell culture medium was also reduced. Overall, mTORC2 plays a critical role in regulating lipogenic gene expression, lipid synthesis, and secretion in pBMECs, and this process probably is through PPARγ. This finding provides a model by which lipogenesis is regulated in pBMECs."
30857324,Molecular Characterization of Microtubule Affinity-Regulating Kinase4 from Sus scrofa and Promotion of Lipogenesis in Primary Porcine Placental Trophoblasts,"Abstract:This study aimed to characterize the full-length cDNA of MARK4 in Sus scrofa, and evaluated its potential role in the regulation of lipid accumulation in pig placental trophoblasts and analyzed signaling pathways involved, thereby providing insights into mechanisms for placental lipotoxicity induced by excessive back-fat during pregnancy of sows. The cDNA obtained with 5' and 3' RACE amplification covered 3216 bp with an open reading frame of 2259 bp encoding 752 amino acids. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed MARK4 protein of Sus scrofa had a high homology (95%⁻99%) to that of other higher vertebrates. After transfection, enhanced MARK4 significantly promoted lipogenesis in pig trophoblasts, as evidenced by accelerated lipid accumulation and consistently increased mRNA expressions of lipogenic genes DGAT1, LPIN1, LPIN3, LPL, PPARδ and SREBP-1c. Meanwhile, PPARγ remarkably inhibited the stimulating effect of MARK4 on non-receptor-mediated lipid accumulation in trophoblasts. Further analyses revealed WNT signaling enhanced lipid accumulation and activation of MARK4 in pig trophoblast cells. Finally, we demonstrated that WNT/β-catenin signal pathway is involved in MARK4 activated lipogenesis. These results suggest that MARK4 promotes lipid accumulation in porcine placental trophoblasts and can be considered as a potential regulator of lipotoxicity associated with maternal obesity in the pig placenta.              Keywords:                    MARK4; PPARγ; WNT; lipogenesis; molecular cloning; pig; placenta."
32908177,Effects of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid sources on expression of lipid-related genes in bovine milk somatic cells,"Abstract:The objective of this study was to compare the effect of contrasting sources of dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA on expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in dairy cows. During 63 days, fifteen lactating cows were assigned to a control or basal diet containing no added lipid (n = 5 cows); and treatment diets supplemented with SO (n = 5 cows; unrefined soybean oil; 2.9% of DM) or FO (n = 5 cows; fish oil manufactured from salmon oil; 2.9% of DM). Plasma for fatty acid (FA) analysis and milk somatic cells (MSC) were obtained from all cows at the beginning of the study (day 0) and on days 21, 42 and 63. Plasma was used to determine FA transport dynamics. Compared with control and FO, plasma from SO had increased contents of C18:1 cis-9, C18:1 trans-11, C18:2 cis-9, trans-11 and total monounsaturated FA. On the other hand, compared with control and SO, FO increased plasma contents of C20:3 n-3, C20:3 n-6, C20:4 n-6, C20:5 n-3, C22:6 n-3 and total polyunsaturated FA. Moreover, plasma C18:3 n-3 and C20:5 n-3 increased over time for all diets. Compared with control, SO downregulated ACACA, INSIG1, and DGAT1, whereas FO downregulated ACACA, PPARGC1, LPIN1 and FABP3 on day 63, in MSC. At different time-points, SO and FO downregulated genes related to synthesis and intracellular transport of FA, synthesis of triglycerides, and transcription factors."
18671863,Gene networks driving bovine milk fat synthesis during the lactation cycle,"Abstract                        Background:                    The molecular events associated with regulation of milk fat synthesis in the bovine mammary gland remain largely unknown. Our objective was to study mammary tissue mRNA expression via quantitative PCR of 45 genes associated with lipid synthesis (triacylglycerol and phospholipids) and secretion from the late pre-partum/non-lactating period through the end of subsequent lactation. mRNA expression was coupled with milk fatty acid (FA) composition and calculated indexes of FA desaturation and de novo synthesis by the mammary gland.              Results:                    Marked up-regulation and/or % relative mRNA abundance during lactation were observed for genes associated with mammary FA uptake from blood (LPL, CD36), intracellular FA trafficking (FABP3), long-chain (ACSL1) and short-chain (ACSS2) intracellular FA activation, de novo FA synthesis (ACACA, FASN), desaturation (SCD, FADS1), triacylglycerol synthesis (AGPAT6, GPAM, LPIN1), lipid droplet formation (BTN1A1, XDH), ketone body utilization (BDH1), and transcription regulation (INSIG1, PPARG, PPARGC1A). Change in SREBF1 mRNA expression during lactation, thought to be central for milk fat synthesis regulation, was < or =2-fold in magnitude, while expression of INSIG1, which negatively regulates SREBP activation, was >12-fold and had a parallel pattern of expression to PPARGC1A. Genes involved in phospholipid synthesis had moderate up-regulation in expression and % relative mRNA abundance. The mRNA abundance and up-regulation in expression of ABCG2 during lactation was markedly high, suggesting a biological role of this gene in milk synthesis/secretion. Weak correlations were observed between both milk FA composition and desaturase indexes (i.e., apparent SCD activity) with mRNA expression pattern of genes measured.              Conclusion:                    A network of genes participates in coordinating milk fat synthesis and secretion. Results challenge the proposal that SREBF1 is central for milk fat synthesis regulation and highlight a pivotal role for a concerted action among PPARG, PPARGC1A, and INSIG1. Expression of SCD, the most abundant gene measured, appears to be key during milk fat synthesis. The lack of correlation between gene expression and calculated desaturase indexes does not support their use to infer mRNA expression or enzyme activity (e.g., SCD). Longitudinal mRNA expression allowed development of transcriptional regulation networks and an updated model of milk fat synthesis regulation."
20403060,"Testosterone modulates gene expression pathways regulating nutrient accumulation, glucose metabolism and protein turnover in mouse skeletal muscle","Abstract:Testosterone regulates energy metabolism and skeletal muscle mass in males, but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. This study investigated the response of skeletal muscle to castration and testosterone replacement in 8-week-old male mice. Using microarray analyses of mRNA levels in gastrocnemius muscle, 91 genes were found to be negatively regulated by testosterone and 68 genes were positively regulated. The mRNA levels of the insulin signalling suppressor molecule Grb10 and the glycogen synthesis inhibitors, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 and phosphorylase kinase-γ, were negatively regulated by testosterone. The insulin-sensitive glucose and amino acid transporters, Glut3 and SAT2, the lipodystrophy gene, Lpin1 and protein targeting to glycogen were positively regulated. These changes would be expected to increase nutrient availability and sensing within skeletal muscle, increase metabolic rate and carbohydrate utilization and promote glycogen accumulation. The observed positive regulation of atrogin-1 (Fbxo32) by testosterone could be explained by the phosphorylation of Akt and Foxo3a, as determined by Western blotting. Testosterone prevented the castration-induced increase in interleukin-1α, the decrease in interferon-γ and the atrophy of the levator ani muscle, which were all correlated with testosterone-regulated gene expression. These findings identify specific mechanisms by which testosterone may regulate skeletal muscle glucose and protein metabolism."
21549711,Cardiac lipin 1 expression is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator 1α/estrogen related receptor axis,"Abstract:Lipin family proteins (lipin 1, 2, and 3) are bifunctional intracellular proteins that regulate metabolism by acting as coregulators of DNA-bound transcription factors and also dephosphorylate phosphatidate to form diacylglycerol [phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity] in the triglyceride synthesis pathway. Herein, we report that lipin 1 is enriched in heart and that hearts of mice lacking lipin 1 (fld mice) exhibit accumulation of phosphatidate. We also demonstrate that the expression of the gene encoding lipin 1 (Lpin1) is under the control of the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) and their coactivator the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). PGC-1α, ERRα, or ERRγ overexpression increased Lpin1 transcription in cultured ventricular myocytes and the ERRs were associated with response elements in the first intron of the Lpin1 gene. Concomitant RNAi-mediated knockdown of ERRα and ERRγ abrogated the induction of lipin 1 expression by PGC-1α overexpression. Consistent with these data, 3-fold overexpression of PGC-1α in intact myocardium of transgenic mice increased cardiac lipin 1 and ERRα/γ expression. Similarly, injection of the β2-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol induced PGC-1α and lipin 1 expression, and the induction in lipin 1 after clenbuterol occurred in a PGC-1α-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of PGC-1α, ERRα, ERRγ, and lipin 1 was down-regulated in failing heart. Cardiac phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activity was also diminished, while cardiac phosphatidate content was increased, in failing heart. Collectively, these data suggest that lipin 1 is the principal lipin protein in the myocardium and is regulated in response to physiologic and pathologic stimuli that impact cardiac metabolism."
21187916,Genome-wide analysis of glucocorticoid receptor binding regions in adipocytes reveal gene network involved in triglyceride homeostasis,"Abstract:Glucocorticoids play important roles in the regulation of distinct aspects of adipocyte biology. Excess glucocorticoids in adipocytes are associated with metabolic disorders, including central obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. To understand the mechanisms underlying the glucocorticoid action in adipocytes, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to isolate genome-wide glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding regions (GBRs) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, gene expression analyses were used to identify genes that were regulated by glucocorticoids. Overall, 274 glucocorticoid-regulated genes contain or locate nearby GBR. We found that many GBRs were located in or nearby genes involved in triglyceride (TG) synthesis (Scd-1, 2, 3, GPAT3, GPAT4, Agpat2, Lpin1), lipolysis (Lipe, Mgll), lipid transport (Cd36, Lrp-1, Vldlr, Slc27a2) and storage (S3-12). Gene expression analysis showed that except for Scd-3, the other 13 genes were induced in mouse inguinal fat upon 4-day glucocorticoid treatment. Reporter gene assays showed that except Agpat2, the other 12 glucocorticoid-regulated genes contain at least one GBR that can mediate hormone response. In agreement with the fact that glucocorticoids activated genes in both TG biosynthetic and lipolytic pathways, we confirmed that 4-day glucocorticoid treatment increased TG synthesis and lipolysis concomitantly in inguinal fat. Notably, we found that 9 of these 12 genes were induced in transgenic mice that have constant elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels. These results suggested that a similar mechanism was used to regulate TG homeostasis during chronic glucocorticoid treatment. In summary, our studies have identified molecular components in a glucocorticoid-controlled gene network involved in the regulation of TG homeostasis in adipocytes. Understanding the regulation of this gene network should provide important insight for future therapeutic developments for metabolic diseases."
29732362,Combining Genetic Variants to Improve Risk Prediction for NAFLD and Its Progression to Cirrhosis: A Proof of Concept Study,"Abstract                        Background & aims:                    Identifying NAFLD patients at risk of progression is crucial to orient medical care and resources. We aimed to verify if the effects determined by different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could add up to multiply the risk of NAFLD and NASH-cirrhosis.              Methods:                    Three study populations, that is, patients diagnosed with NASH-cirrhosis or with noncirrhotic NAFLD and healthy controls, were enrolled. PNPLA3 rs738409, TM6SF2 rs58542926, KLF6 rs3750861, SOD2 rs4880, and LPIN1 rs13412852 were genotyped.              Results:                    One hundred and seven NASH-cirrhotics, 93 noncirrhotic NAFLD, and 90 controls were enrolled. At least one difference in allele frequency between groups was significant, or nearly significant, for the PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and KLF6 variants (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p = 0.06, resp.), and a risk score based on these SNPs was generated. No differences were observed for SOD2 and LPIN1 SNPs. When compared to a score of 0, a score of 1-2 quadrupled, and a score of 3-4 increased 20-fold the risk of noncirrhotic NAFLD; a score of 3-4 quadrupled the risk of NASH-cirrhosis.              Conclusions:                    The effects determined by disease-associated variants at different loci can add up to multiply the risk of NAFLD and NASH-cirrhosis. Combining different disease-associated variants may represent the way for genetics to keep strength in NAFLD diagnostics."
30649892,Metformin counteracts glucose-dependent lipogenesis and impairs transdeamination in the liver of gilthead sea bream ( Sparus aurata),"Abstract:Metformin is an antidiabetic drug with a major impact on regulating blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis, but also by affecting other pathways, including glucose transport and energy/lipid metabolism. Carnivorous fish are considered glucose intolerant, as they exhibit poor ability in using dietary carbohydrates. To increase the current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which metformin can improve glucose homeostasis in carnivorous fish, we addressed the effect of intraperitoneal administration of metformin, in the presence or absence of a glucose load, on metabolic rate-limiting enzymes and lipogenic factors in the liver of gilthead sea bream ( Sparus aurata). Hyperglycemia markedly upregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, PFK1) 5 h following glucose administration, while at 24 h posttreatment, it increased isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activity, a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the expression of lipogenic factors (PGC1β, Lpin1, and SREBP1). Metformin counteracted glucose-dependent effects, and downregulated glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and mammalian target of rapamycin 5 h posttreatment in the absence of a glucose load, leading to decreased long-term activity of PFK1 and IDH. The results of the present study suggest that hyperglycemia enhances lipogenesis in the liver of S. aurata and that metformin may exert specific metabolic effects in fish by decreasing hepatic transdeamination and suppressing the use of amino acids as gluconeogenic substrates. Our findings highlight the role of amino acid metabolism in the glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish model.              Keywords:                    glutamate dehydrogenase; lipogenesis; liver; metformin."
22157014,Lipin-1 phosphatidic phosphatase activity modulates phosphatidate levels to promote peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) gene expression during adipogenesis,"Abstract:Adipose tissue plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis. Disruption of the Lpin1 gene encoding lipin-1 causes impaired adipose tissue development and function in rodents. Lipin-1 functions as a phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzyme in the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway for triglyceride storage and as a transcriptional coactivator/corepressor for metabolic nuclear receptors. Previous studies established that lipin-1 is required at an early step in adipocyte differentiation for induction of the adipogenic gene transcription program, including the key regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Here, we investigate the requirement of lipin-1 PAP versus coactivator function in the establishment of Pparg expression during adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that PAP activity supplied by lipin-1, lipin-2, or lipin-3, but not lipin-1 coactivator activity, can rescue Pparg gene expression and lipogenesis during adipogenesis in lipin-1-deficient preadipocytes. In adipose tissue from lipin-1-deficient mice, there is an accumulation of phosphatidate species containing a range of medium chain fatty acids and an activation of the MAPK/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Phosphatidate inhibits differentiation of cultured adipocytes, and this can be rescued by the expression of lipin-1 PAP activity or by inhibition of ERK signaling. These results emphasize the importance of lipid intermediates as choreographers of gene regulation during adipogenesis, and the results highlight a specific role for lipins as determinants of levels of a phosphatidic acid pool that influences Pparg expression."
19494126,Inactivation of the C. elegans lipin homolog leads to ER disorganization and to defects in the breakdown and reassembly of the nuclear envelope,"Abstract:The nuclear envelope (NE) is a dynamic structure, undergoing periods of growth, breakdown and reassembly during the cell cycle. In yeast, altering lipid synthesis by inactivating the yeast homolog of lipin, a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, leads to disorganization of the peripheral ER and abnormal nuclear shape. These results suggest that lipid metabolism contributes to NE dynamics; however, since yeast undergo closed mitosis, the relevance of these observations to higher eukaryotes is unclear. In mammals, lipin has been implicated in adipose tissue differentiation, insulin resistance, lipid storage and obesity, but the underlying cellular defects caused by altering lipin levels are not known. Here, we identify the Caenorhabditis elegans lipin homolog (LPIN-1) and examine its affect on NE dynamics. We find that downregulating LPIN-1 by RNAi results in the appearance of membrane sheets and other abnormal structures in the peripheral ER. Moreover, lpin-1 RNAi causes defects in NE breakdown, abnormal chromosome segregation and irregular nuclear morphology. These results uncover cellular processes affected by lipin in metazoa, and suggest that lipid synthesis has a role in NE dynamics."
27474983,Fish oil-induced milk fat depression and associated downregulation of mammary lipogenic genes in dairy ewes,"Abstract:Several studies in dairy cows have shown a relationship between milk fat depression (MFD) and alterations caused in lipogenic gene expression by dietary nutrients. However, information on small ruminants is not only scarce but also inconsistent. Therefore, this experiment was conducted in dairy ewes to study the effect of a diet known to induce MFD on milk fatty acid (FA) composition and mRNA abundance of key candidate genes involved in mammary lipogenesis. Twelve lactating Assaf ewes (on average 63d in milk) were randomly assigned to 2 treatments consisting of a total mixed ration based on alfalfa hay and concentrates (50:50), supplemented with 0 (control) or 17g of fish oil/kg of diet dry matter (FO). Profiles of milk FA and mRNA abundance of candidate genes in biopsied mammary tissue were examined before starting the treatments and after 1 and 4.5wk on the diets. As expected, FO induced MFD and modified milk FA composition. Compared with the control, reductions in milk fat concentration and yield were not detected on d 7, but reached up to 25 and 22%, respectively, on d 30. However, increases in confirmed or putative antilipogenic FA (trans-10,cis-12 and trans-9,cis-11 18:2, cis-9 16:1, cis-11 18:1, and oxo-FA) were already established on the early stage of the treatment and lasted until the end of the feeding period. These changes were accompanied by decreases in the mRNA abundance of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes. The coordinated nature of the downregulation, which tended to affect most studied metabolic pathways, including FA activation (ACSS1), de novo synthesis (ACACA and FASN), uptake and transport (LPL and FABP3), desaturation (SCD1), and esterification (AGAPT6), supports the involvement of a central regulator of milk fat synthesis. In this regard, without ruling out the potential contribution of PPARG, our results suggest that SREBF1 would have a relevant role in the MFD syndrome in sheep fed FO. Among the other studied transcription factors, the tendency to a downregulation of INSIG1 was associated with that of SREBF1, whereas no variation was detected for SCAP or THRSP. Fish oil had no significant effects on the transcript abundance of CD36, GPAM, DGAT1, LPIN1, and XDH. Overall, changes in potential antilipogenic FA and mRNA abundance of candidate lipogenic genes support a relationship between them and suggest that FO-induced MFD in dairy ewes would be mediated by transcriptional mechanisms.

16950137,Lipin 1 is an inducible amplifier of the hepatic PGC-1alpha/PPARalpha regulatory pathway,"Abstract:Perturbations in hepatic lipid homeostasis are linked to the development of obesity-related steatohepatitis. Mutations in the gene encoding lipin 1 cause hepatic steatosis in fld mice, a genetic model of lipodystrophy. However, the molecular function of lipin 1 is unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that the expression of lipin 1 is induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a transcriptional coactivator controlling several key hepatic metabolic pathways. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function strategies demonstrated that lipin selectively activates a subset of PGC-1alpha target pathways, including fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, while suppressing the lipogenic program and lowering circulating lipid levels. Lipin activates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative metabolism by inducing expression of the nuclear receptor PPARalpha, a known PGC-1alpha target, and via direct physical interactions with PPARalpha and PGC-1alpha. These results identify lipin 1 as a selective physiological amplifier of the PGC-1alpha/PPARalpha-mediated control of hepatic lipid metabolism."
32646377,Identification of candidate genes for milk production traits by RNA sequencing on bovine liver at different lactation stages,"Abstract                        Background:                    RNA-sequencing was performed to explore the bovine liver transcriptomes of Holstein cows to detect potential functional genes related to lactation and milk composition traits in dairy cattle. The bovine transcriptomes of the nine liver samples from three Holstein cows during dry period (50-d prepartum), early lactation (10-d postpartum), and peak of lactation (60-d postpartum) were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.              Results:                    A total of 204, 147 and 81 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, p < 0.05, false discovery rate q < 0.05) were detected in early lactation vs. dry period, peak of lactation vs. dry period, and peak of lactation vs. early lactation comparison groups, respectively. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in specific biological processes related to metabolic and biosynthetic and signaling pathways of PPAR, AMPK and p53 (p < 0.05). Ten genes were identified as promising candidates affecting milk yield, milk protein and fat traits in dairy cattle by using an integrated analysis of differential gene expression, previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL), data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and biological function information. These genes were APOC2, PPP1R3B, PKLR, ODC1, DUSP1, LMNA, GALE, ANGPTL4, LPIN1 and CDKN1A.              Conclusion:                    This study explored the complexity of the liver transcriptome across three lactation periods in dairy cattle by performing RNA sequencing. Integrated analysis of DEGs and reported QTL and GWAS data allowed us to find ten key candidate genes influencing milk production traits.

17463059,Lipin1 regulation by estrogen in uterus and liver: implications for diabetes and fertility,"Abstract:Estrogens are essential for fertility and also have important effects on regulation of adiposity and the euglycemic state. We report here that lipin1, a candidate gene for lipodystrophy and obesity that is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase critical in regulation of cellular levels of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol and a key regulator of lipid utilization, is rapidly and robustly down-regulated in the uterus by estradiol via the estrogen receptor. Lipin1 is expressed predominantly in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium, and during the estrous cycle, lipin1 is lowest when blood levels of estrogen are highest. Lipin1 is expressed throughout all cells in the liver of ovariectomized female mice, and a sustained down-regulation is observed at the mRNA, protein and immunohistochemical levels after estrogen administration. Because the coupling of proper energy use and availability is central to reproduction, we also investigated expression of lipin1 in the uterus and liver of several mouse models of diabetes. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which have high blood levels of estrogen and impaired fertility, were severely deficient in lipin1 in the uterus and liver, which, interestingly, could be restored by insulin treatment. By contrast, nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice, which do not develop diabetes, showed normal levels of lipin1. Our findings of lipin1 regulation by estrogen in two key target organs suggest a new role for this lipid-regulating phosphatase not only in central metabolic regulation but also in uterine function and reproductive biology. Estrogen regulation of lipin1 may provide a mechanistic link between estrogens, lipid metabolism, and lipid signaling."
30617183,Casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of lipin 1β phosphatidate phosphatase at Ser-285 and Ser-287 regulates its interaction with 14-3-3β protein,"Abstract:The mammalian lipin 1 phosphatidate phosphatase is a key regulatory enzyme in lipid metabolism. By catalyzing phosphatidate dephosphorylation, which produces diacylglycerol, the enzyme plays a major role in the synthesis of triacylglycerol and membrane phospholipids. The importance of lipin 1 to lipid metabolism is exemplified by cellular defects and lipid-based diseases associated with its loss or overexpression. Phosphorylation of lipin 1 governs whether it is associated with the cytoplasm apart from its substrate or with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where its enzyme reaction occurs. Lipin 1β is phosphorylated on multiple sites, but less than 10% of them are ascribed to a specific protein kinase. Here, we demonstrate that lipin 1β is a bona fide substrate for casein kinase II (CKII), a protein kinase that is essential to viability and cell cycle progression. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping revealed that lipin 1β is phosphorylated by CKII on multiple serine and threonine residues, with the former being major sites. Mutational analysis of lipin 1β and its peptides indicated that Ser-285 and Ser-287 are both phosphorylated by CKII. Substitutions of Ser-285 and Ser-287 with nonphosphorylatable alanine attenuated the interaction of lipin 1β with 14-3-3β protein, a regulatory hub that facilitates the cytoplasmic localization of phosphorylated lipin 1. These findings advance our understanding of how phosphorylation of lipin 1β phosphatidate phosphatase regulates its interaction with 14-3-3β protein and intracellular localization and uncover a mechanism by which CKII regulates cellular physiology.              Keywords:                    14–3-3 protein; casein kinase II; cell signaling; diacylglycerol; lipid droplet; lipin 1 PA phosphatase; membrane phospholipid; phosphatase; phosphatidate; protein kinase; protein phosphorylation; triacylglycerol."
22492381,Analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected nutrient-sensitive genes in weight-regain prevention: the DIOGENES study,"Abstract                        Background:                    Differences in the interindividual response to dietary intervention could be modified by genetic variation in nutrient-sensitive genes.              Objective:                    This study examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in presumed nutrient-sensitive candidate genes for obesity and obesity-related diseases for main and dietary interaction effects on weight, waist circumference, and fat mass regain over 6 mo.              Design:                    In total, 742 participants who had lost ≥ 8% of their initial body weight were randomly assigned to follow 1 of 5 different ad libitum diets with different glycemic indexes and contents of dietary protein. The SNP main and SNP-diet interaction effects were analyzed by using linear regression models, corrected for multiple testing by using Bonferroni correction and evaluated by using quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots.              Results:                    After correction for multiple testing, none of the SNPs were significantly associated with weight, waist circumference, or fat mass regain. Q-Q plots showed that ALOX5AP rs4769873 showed a higher observed than predicted P value for the association with less waist circumference regain over 6 mo (-3.1 cm/allele; 95% CI: -4.6, -1.6; P/Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.000039/0.076), independently of diet. Additional associations were identified by using Q-Q plots for SNPs in ALOX5AP, TNF, and KCNJ11 for main effects; in LPL and TUB for glycemic index interaction effects on waist circumference regain; in GHRL, CCK, MLXIPL, and LEPR on weight; in PPARC1A, PCK2, ALOX5AP, PYY, and ADRB3 on waist circumference; and in PPARD, FABP1, PLAUR, and LPIN1 on fat mass regain for dietary protein interaction.              Conclusion:                    The observed effects of SNP-diet interactions on weight, waist, and fat mass regain suggest that genetic variation in nutrient-sensitive genes can modify the response to diet. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00390637."
33665188,Genome-Wide Analysis of Differentially Expressed miRNAs and Their Associated Regulatory Networks in Lenses Deficient for the Congenital Cataract-Linked Tudor Domain Containing Protein TDRD7,"Abstract:Mutations/deficiency of TDRD7, encoding a tudor domain protein involved in post-transcriptional gene expression control, causes early onset cataract in humans. While Tdrd7 is implicated in the control of key lens mRNAs, the impact of Tdrd7 deficiency on microRNAs (miRNAs) and how this contributes to transcriptome misexpression and to cataracts, is undefined. We address this critical knowledge-gap by investigating Tdrd7-targeted knockout (Tdrd7-/-) mice that exhibit fully penetrant juvenile cataracts. We performed Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 microarray analysis on Tdrd7-/- mouse lenses at postnatal day (P) 4, a stage preceding cataract formation. This analysis identifies 22 miRNAs [14 over-expressed (miR-15a, miR-19a, miR-138, miR-328, miR-339, miR-345, miR-378b, miR-384, miR-467a, miR-1224, miR-1935, miR-1946a, miR-3102, miR-3107), 8 reduced (let-7b, miR-34c, miR-298, miR-382, miR-409, miR-1198, miR-1947, miR-3092)] to be significantly misexpressed (fold-change ≥ ± 1.2, p-value < 0.05) in Tdrd7-/- lenses. To understand how these misexpressed miRNAs impact Tdrd7-/- cataract, we predicted their mRNA targets and examined their misexpression upon Tdrd7-deficiency by performing comparative transcriptomics analysis on P4 and P30 Tdrd7-/- lens. To prioritize these target mRNAs, we used various stringency filters (e.g., fold-change in Tdrd7-/- lens, iSyTE-based lens-enriched expression) and identified 98 reduced and 89 elevated mRNA targets for overexpressed and reduced miRNAs, respectively, which were classified as ""top-priority"" ""high-priority,"" and ""promising"" candidates. For Tdrd7-/- lens overexpressed miRNAs, this approach identified 18 top-priority reduced target mRNAs: Alad, Ankrd46, Ceacam10, Dgat2, Ednrb, H2-Eb1, Klhl22, Lin7a, Loxl1, Lpin1, Npc1, Olfm1, Ppm1e, Ppp1r1a, Rgs8, Shisa4, Snx22 and Wnk2. Majority of these targets were also altered in other gene-specific perturbation mouse models (e.g., Brg1, E2f1/E2f2/E2f3, Foxe3, Hsf4, Klf4, Mafg/Mafk, Notch) of lens defects/cataract, suggesting their importance to lens biology. Gene ontology (GO) provided further insight into their relevance to lens pathology. For example, the Tdrd7-deficient lens capsule defect may be explained by reduced mRNA targets (e.g., Col4a3, Loxl1, Timp2, Timp3) associated with ""basement membrane"". GO analysis also identified new genes (e.g., Casz1, Rasgrp1) recently linked to lens biology/pathology. Together, these analyses define a new Tdrd7-downstream miRNA-mRNA network, in turn, uncovering several new mRNA targets and their associated pathways relevant to lens biology and offering molecular insights into the pathology of congenital cataract.

20603810,"mRNA abundance and expression of SLC27A, ACC, SCD, FADS, LPIN, INSIG, and PPARGC1 gene isoforms in mouse mammary glands during the lactation cycle","Abstract:The functions of distinct isoforms of solute carrier family 27 transporters (SLC27A1-6), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA, ACACB), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1-4), fatty acid desaturase (FADS1-3), LPIN (LPIN1-3), insulin-induced gene (INSIG1, 2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator1 (PPARGC1A, B) were studied in the mouse mammary gland from pregnancy to lactation. The relative mRNA abundance and percent change in real-time PCR were determined. mRNA expression of SLC27A3 and SLC27A4 was 37- and 1.4-fold more upregulated at 12 days of lactation, respectively (P < 0.01). Transcripts of SCD isoforms were the most abundant, accounting for 59% of all genes measured, and PPARGC1 isoforms were the least (0.06% of all genes measured). The mRNA abundance from ACC, FADS and LPIN accounted for 29, 9 and 2.6%, respectively. INSIG1 mRNA expression was 32-fold more upregulated (P < 0.05), while PPARGC1B was 0.18-fold downregulated at 18 days of lactation (P < 0.01). We concluded that mRNA abundance and expression of these isoforms are affected by the stage of lactation."
19136718,Lipin 2 is a liver-enriched phosphatidate phosphohydrolase enzyme that is dynamically regulated by fasting and obesity in mice,"Abstract:Lipin 1 is a bifunctional intracellular protein that regulates fatty acid metabolism in the nucleus via interactions with DNA-bound transcription factors and at the endoplasmic reticulum as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase enzyme (PAP-1) to catalyze the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis. However, livers of 8-day-old mice lacking lipin 1 (fld mice) exhibited normal PAP-1 activity and a 20-fold increase in triglyceride levels. We sought to further analyze the hepatic lipid profile of these mice by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, hepatic content of phosphatidate, the substrate of PAP-1 enzymes, was markedly diminished in fld mice. Similarly, other phospholipids derived from phosphatidate, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, were also depleted. Another member of the lipin family (lipin 2) is enriched in liver, and hepatic lipin 2 protein content was markedly increased by lipin 1 deficiency, food deprivation, and obesity, often independent of changes in steady-state mRNA levels. Importantly, RNAi against lipin 2 markedly reduced PAP-1 activity in hepatocytes from both wild type and fld mice and suppressed triglyceride synthesis under conditions of high fatty acid availability. Collectively, these data suggest that lipin 2 plays an important role as a hepatic PAP-1 enzyme."
19201733,Depot-specific effects of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone on adipose tissue glucose uptake and metabolism,"Abstract:We investigated mechanisms whereby peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonism redistributes lipid from visceral (VF) toward subcutaneous fat (SF) by studying the impact of PPARgamma activation on VF and SF glucose uptake and metabolism, lipogenesis, and enzymes involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. VF (retroperitoneal) and SF (inguinal) of rats treated or not for 7 days with rosiglitazone (15 mg/kg/day) were evaluated in vivo for glucose uptake and lipogenesis and in vitro for glucose metabolism, gene expression, and activities of glycerolphosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (or lipin-1), and diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Rosiglitazone increased SF glucose uptake, GLUT4 mRNA, and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, conversion to lactate, glycogen, and the glycerol and fatty acid components of TAG. In VF, only glucose incorporation into TAG-glycerol was stimulated by rosiglitazone and less so than in SF (1.5- vs. 3-fold). mRNA levels of proteins involved in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, glycogen synthesis, and lipogenesis were markedly upregulated by rosiglitazone in SF and again less so in VF. Rosiglitazone activated TAG-glycerol synthesis in vivo (2.8- vs. 1.9-fold) and lipin activity (4.6- vs. 1.5-fold) more strongly in SF than VF, whereas GPAT activity was increased similarly in both depots. The preferential increase in glucose uptake and intracellular metabolism in SF contributes to the PPARgamma-mediated redistribution of TAG from VF to SF, which in turn favors global insulin sensitization."
22348461,"Folate depletion changes gene expression of fatty acid metabolism, DNA synthesis, and circadian cycle in male mice","Abstract:Folate is essential for purine and thymidylate biosynthesis and in methyl transfer for DNA methylation. Folate deficiency alters the secretion of melatonin, a hormone involved in circadian rhythm entrainment, and causes hyperhomocysteinemia because of disruption of homocysteine metabolism. Adverse effects of homocysteine include the generation of free radicals, activation of proliferation or apoptosis, and alteration of gene expression. The liver is an important organ for folate metabolism, and its genome analysis has revealed numerous clock-regulated genes. The variations at the level of their expression during folate deficiency are not known. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of folate deficiency on gene expression in the mouse liver. A control group receiving a synthetic diet and a folate-depleted group were housed for 4 weeks on a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark cycle. Three mice from each group were euthanized under dim red light at the beginning of the light cycle, and 3, at the beginning of the dark period. Gene expression was studied in a microarray analysis. Of the 53 genes showing modified daily expression in the controls, 52 showed a less marked or no difference after folate depletion. Only 1, lpin1, showed a more marked difference. Ten genes coding for proteins involved in lipid metabolism did not show a morning/evening difference in controls but did after folate depletion. This study shows that, in the mouse liver, dietary folate depletion leads to major changes in expression of several genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, DNA synthesis, and expression of circadian genes."
18940942,LPS and proinflammatory cytokines decrease lipin-1 in mouse adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 adipocytes,"Abstract:Infection and inflammation affect adipose triglyceride metabolism, resulting in increased plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and VLDL levels during the acute-phase response. Lipin-1, a multifunctional protein, plays a critical role in adipose differentiation, mitochondrial oxidation, and triglyceride synthesis. Here, we examined whether LPS [a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 activator], zymosan (a TLR-2 activator), and proinflammatory cytokines regulate lipin-1 in adipose tissue. LPS administration caused a marked decrease in the levels of lipin-1 mRNA and protein in adipose tissue. The decrease in lipin-1 mRNA levels occurred rapidly and lasted for at least 24 h. In contrast, lipin-2 and -3 mRNA levels did not change, suggesting specific repression of lipin-1. Zymosan similarly decreased lipin-1 mRNA without affecting lipin-2 or lipin-3 mRNA levels. To determine the pathways by which LPS repressed lipin-1, we examined the effect of proinflammatory cytokines on cultured adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma, but not LPS or IL-6, caused a decrease in lipin-1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta administration also decreased mRNA levels of lipin-1 in adipose tissue in mice. Importantly, the LPS-induced decrease in lipin-1 mRNA levels was significantly but not totally blunted in TNF-alpha/IL-1 receptor-null mice compared with controls, suggesting key roles for TNF-alpha/IL-1beta and other cytokines in mediating LPS-induced repression of lipin-1. Together, our results demonstrate that expression of lipin-1, one of the essential triglyceride synthetic enzymes, was suppressed by LPS, zymosan, and proinflammatory cytokines in mouse adipose tissue and in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which could contribute to a decrease in the utilization of FFA to synthesize triglycerides in adipose tissue, thus promoting the release of FFA into the circulation."
27391332,"Skipped BSCL2 Transcript in Celia's Encephalopathy (PELD): New Insights on Fatty Acids Involvement, Senescence and Adipogenesis","Abstract                        Objective:                    PELD (Progressive Encephalopathy with or without Lipodystrophy or Celia's Encephalopathy) is a fatal and rare neurodegenerative syndrome associated with the BSCL2 mutation c.985C>T, that results in an aberrant transcript without the exon 7 (Celia seipin). The aim of this study was to evaluate both the process of cellular senescence and the effect of unsaturated fatty acids on preadipocytes from a homozygous c.985C>T patient. Also, the role of aberrant seipin isoform on adipogenesis was studied in adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cells.              Material and methods:                    Cellular senescence was evaluated using β-galactosidase staining of preadipocytes obtained from a homozygous c.985C>T patient. Moreover, these cells were cultured during 24 hours with Intralipid, a soybean oil-based commercial lipid emulsion. The expression of the different BSCL2 transcripts was measured by qPCR. Adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cells were differentiated to a fat lineage using StemPRO adipogenesis kit, and the expression of BSCL2 transcripts and several adipogenesis-related genes was measured by qPCR.              Results:                    the treatment of preadipocytes with unsaturated fatty acids significantly reduced the expression of the BSCL2 transcript without exon 7 by 34 to 63%. On the other hand, at least in preadipocytes, this mutation does not disturb cellular senescence rate. Finally, during adipocyte differentiation of adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cells, the expression of adipogenic genes (PPARG, LPIN1, and LPL) increased significantly over 14 days, and noteworthy is that the BSCL2 transcript without exon 7 was differentially expressed by 332 to 723% when compared to day 0, suggesting an underlying role in adipogenesis.              Conclusions:                    our results suggest that Celia seipin is probably playing an underestimated role in adipocyte maturation, but not in senescence, and its expression can be modified by exogenous factors as fatty acids."
24133206,Distinct roles of the phosphatidate phosphatases lipin 1 and 2 during adipogenesis and lipid droplet biogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells,"Abstract:Lipins are evolutionarily conserved Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes with essential roles in lipid biosynthesis. Mammals express three paralogues: lipins 1, 2, and 3. Loss of lipin 1 in mice inhibits adipogenesis at an early stage of differentiation and results in a lipodystrophic phenotype. The role of lipins at later stages of adipogenesis, when cells initiate the formation of lipid droplets, is less well characterized. We found that depletion of lipin 1, after the initiation of differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells but before the loading of lipid droplets with triacylglycerol, results in a reciprocal increase of lipin 2, but not lipin 3. We generated 3T3-L1 cells where total lipin protein and PAP activity levels are down-regulated by the combined depletion of lipins 1 and 2 at day 4 of differentiation. These cells still accumulated triacylglycerol but displayed a striking fragmentation of lipid droplets without significantly affecting their total volume per cell. This was due to the lack of the PAP activity of lipin 1 in adipocytes after day 4 of differentiation, whereas depletion of lipin 2 led to an increase of lipid droplet volume per cell. We propose that in addition to their roles during early adipogenesis, lipins also have a role in lipid droplet biogenesis.

19717560,A conserved serine residue is required for the phosphatidate phosphatase activity but not the transcriptional coactivator functions of lipin-1 and lipin-2,"Abstract:Mammalian lipins (lipin-1, lipin-2, and lipin-3) are Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes, which catalyze a key reaction in glycerolipid biosynthesis. Lipin-1 also functions as a transcriptional coactivator in conjunction with members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family. An S734L mutation in LPIN2 causes Majeed syndrome, a human inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent osteomyelitis, fever, dyserythropoietic anemia, and cutaneous inflammation. Here we demonstrate that mutation of the equivalent serine in mouse lipin-1 and lipin-2 to leucine or aspartate abolishes PAP activity but does not impair lipin association with microsomal membranes, the major site of glycerolipid synthesis. We also determined that lipin-2 has transcriptional coactivator activity for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-response elements similar to lipin-1 and that this activity is not affected by mutating the conserved serine. Therefore, our results indicate that the symptoms of the Majeed syndrome result from a loss of lipin-2 PAP activity. To characterize sites of lipin-2 action, we detected lipin-2 expression by in situ hybridization on whole mouse sections and by quantitative PCR of tissues relevant to Majeed syndrome. Lipin-2 was most prominently expressed in liver, where levels were much higher than lipin-1, and also in kidney, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and specific regions of the brain. Lipin-2 was also expressed in circulating red blood cells and sites of lymphopoiesis (bone marrow, thymus, and spleen). These results raise the possibility that the loss of lipin-2 PAP activity in erythrocytes and lymphocytes may contribute to the anemia and inflammation phenotypes observed in Majeed syndrome patients."
31484941,"Evolution, dynamic expression changes and regulatory characteristics of gene families involved in the glycerophosphate pathway of triglyceride synthesis in chicken (Gallus gallus)","Abstract:It is well documented that four gene families, including the glycerophosphate acyltransferases (GPATs), acylglycerophosphate acyltransferases (AGPATs), lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPINs) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), are involved in the glycerophosphate pathway of de novo triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis in mammals. However, no systematic analysis has been conducted to characterize the gene families in poultry. In this study, the sequences of gene family members in the glycerophosphate pathway were obtained by screening the public databases. The phylogenetic tree, gene structures and conserved motifs of the corresponding proteins were evaluated. Dynamic expression changes of the genes at different developmental stages were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The regulatory characteristics of the genes were analyzed by in vivo experiments. The results showed that the GPAT, AGPAT and LPIN gene families have 2, 7 and 2 members, respectively, and they were classified into 2, 4 and 2 cluster respectively based on phylogenetic analysis. All of the genes except AGPAT1 were extensively expressed in various tissues. Estrogen induction upregulated the expression of GPAM and AGPAT2, downregulated the expression of AGPAT3, AGPAT9, LPIN1 and LPIN2, and had no effect on the expression of the other genes. These findings provide a valuable resource for further investigation of lipid metabolism in liver of chicken."
21857965,Dietary cholesterol reduces plasma triacylglycerol in apolipoprotein E-null mice: suppression of lipin-1 and -2 in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway,"Abstract                        Background:                    Cholesterol metabolism is tightly regulated by both cholesterol and its metabolites in the mammalian liver, but the regulatory mechanism of triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis remains to be elucidated. Lipin, which catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol, is a key enzyme involved in de novo TG synthesis in the liver via the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway. However, the regulatory mechanisms for the expression of lipin in the liver are not well understood.              Methodology/principal findings:                    Apolipoprotein E-knock out (apoE-KO) mice were fed a chow supplemented with 1.25% cholesterol (high-Chol diet). Cholesterol and bile acids were highly increased in the liver within a week. However, the amount of TG in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), but not in the liver, was reduced by 78%. The epididymal adipose tissue was almost eradicated in the long term. DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that the mRNA expression of all the genes in the G3P pathway in the liver was suppressed in the high-Chol diet apoE-KO mice. In particular, the mRNA and protein expression of lipin-1 and lipin-2 was markedly decreased, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which up-regulates the transcription of lipin-1, was also suppressed. In vitro analysis using HepG2 cells revealed that the protein expression of lipin-2 was suppressed by treatment with taurocholic acid.              Conclusions/significance:                    These data using apoE-KO mice indicate that cholesterol and its metabolites are involved in regulating TG metabolism through a suppression of lipin-1 and lipin-2 in the liver. This research provides evidence for the mechanism of lipin expression in the liver."
21911493,"Estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) is a novel transcriptional regulator of phosphatidic acid phosphatase, LIPIN1, and inhibits hepatic insulin signaling","Abstract:LIPINs have been reported to perform important roles in the regulation of intracellular lipid levels. Their mutations induce lipodystrophy, myoglobinuria, and inflammatory disorders. Recently, the phosphatidic acid phosphatase function of LIPINs has been associated with the perturbation of hepatic insulin receptor signaling via the diacylglycerol-mediated stimulation of PKCε activity. Here, we report that nuclear estrogen-related receptor (ERR) γ is a novel transcriptional regulator of LIPIN1. Overexpression of ERRγ significantly increased LIPIN1 expression in primary hepatocytes, whereas the abolition of ERRγ gene expression attenuated the expression of LIPIN1. Deletion and mutation analyses of the LIPIN1 promoter showed that ERRγ exerts its effect on the transcriptional regulation of LIPIN1 via ERRE1 of the LIPIN1 promoter, as confirmed by ChIP assay. We also determined that the gene transcription of LIPIN1 by ERRγ is controlled by the competition between PGC-1α and small heterodimer partner. Additionally, ERRγ leads to the induction of hepatic LIPIN1 expression and diacylglycerol production in vivo. Finally, an inverse agonist of ERRγ, GSK5182, restores the impaired insulin signaling induced by LIPIN1-mediated PKCε activation. Our findings indicate that the selective control of ERRγ transcriptional activity by its specific inverse agonist could provide a novel therapeutic approach to the amelioration of impaired hepatic insulin signaling induced by LIPIN1-mediated PKCε activation."
32549891,Lipin-1 Deficiency-Associated Recurrent Rhabdomyolysis and Exercise-Induced Myalgia Persisting into Adulthood: A Case Report and Review of Literature,"Abstract:Phosphatidate phosphatase-1 (lipin-1) is encoded by LPIN1 gene. Lipin-1 deficiency has been reported as the second most common cause of early-onset rhabdomyolysis after primary fatty acid oxidation disorders. We report a case of a 32-year-old Sri Lankan female with a history of more than 10 episodes of rhabdomyolysis and exercise intolerance since childhood. These episodes were triggered by infections and exercise. A temporal relationship between the acute episodes and use of drugs such as theophylline, mefenamic acid, co-trimoxazole, and combined oral contraceptive pills was also noted. There was marked elevation of serum creatine kinase and transaminases during acute episodes. Family history revealed parental consanguinity and an affected sibling who died of an acute episode associated with muscle weakness, dark coloured urine, and cyanosis, at the age of 2 years. The histochemical findings of the patient under discussion were consistent with a metabolic myopathy affecting membrane integrity. A homozygous, likely pathogenic variant c.1684G>T encoding p.(Glu562∗) was identified by clinical exome sequencing. Even though the studies to date give no convincing evidence of a possible causal or contributory relationship between the drugs under discussion and lipin-1 related rhabdomyolysis, this case highlights the importance of pharmacovigilance and reporting adverse drug reactions in patients with lipin-1 deficiency."
27493725,Essential amino acid ratios and mTOR affect lipogenic gene networks and miRNA expression in bovine mammary epithelial cells,"Abstract                        Background:                    The objective of this study was to study how changing the ratio of Lys to Thr, Lys to His, and Lys to Val affects the expression of lipogenic genes and microRNA (miRNA) in bovine mammary epithelial cells.              Results:                    Triplicate cultures with the respective ""optimal"" amino acid (AA) ratio (OPAA = Lys:Met 2.9:1; Thr:Phe 1.05:1; Lys:Thr 1.8:1; Lys:His 2.38:1; Lys:Val 1.23:1) plus rapamycin (OPAARMC; positive control), OPAA, Lys:Thr 2.1:1 (LT2.1), Lys:Thr 1.3:1 (LT1.3), Lys:His 3.05:1 (LH3.0), or Lys:Val 1.62:1 (LV1.6) were incubated in lactogenic medium for 12 h. The expression of 15 lipogenic genes and 7 miRNA were evaluated. Responses to LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6 relative to the control (OPAARMC) included up-regulated expression of ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, SREBF1, PPARD, and NR1H3 (commonly known as LXR-α). Furthermore, LV1.6 up-regulated expression of ACSL1, DGAT1, and RXRA and down-regulated PPARG expression. Although no effect of OPAA on expression of PPARG was observed, compared with the control, OPAA up-regulated expression of the PPAR targets ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, and SREBF1. Compared with the control, the expression of the anti-lipogenic MIR27AB was down-regulated by OPAA, LT2.1, LT1.3 and LH3.0. In contrast, compared with the control, the expression of the pro-lipogenic MIR21 was up-regulated by LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6.              Conclusions:                    The observed up-regulation of lipogenic gene networks and the changes in expression of key miRNA involved in the control of lipogenic balance are indicative of a potentially important role of EAA ratios and mTOR signaling in the regulation of milk fat synthesis.

25026599,Troxerutin improves hepatic lipid homeostasis by restoring NAD(+)-depletion-mediated dysfunction of lipin 1 signaling in high-fat diet-treated mice,"Abstract:Recent evidences suggest that NAD(+) depletion leads to abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the contributing mechanism is not well understood. Our previous study showed that troxerutin, a trihydroxyethylated derivative of natural bioflavonoid rutin, effectively inhibited obesity, and normalized hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in high-cholesterol diet-induced diabetic mice. Here we investigated whether troxerutin improved hepatic lipid metabolism via preventing NAD(+) depletion in HFD-induced NAFLD mouse model and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our results showed that troxerutin markedly prevented obesity, liver steatosis and injury in HFD-fed mice. Troxerutin largely suppressed oxidative stress-mediated NAD(+)-depletion by increasing nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) protein expression and decreasing poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) protein expression and activity in HFD-treated mouse livers. Consequently, troxerutin remarkably restored Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog1 (SirT1) protein expression and activity in HFD-treated mouse livers. Therefore, troxerutin promoted SirT1-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which enhanced nuclear lipin 1 localization, lowered cytoplasmic lipin 1 localization and the ratio of hepatic Lpin 1β/α. Ultimately, troxerutin improved lipid homeostasis by enhancing fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride secretion, and suppressing lipogenesis in HFD-fed mouse livers. In conclusion, troxerutin displayed beneficial effects on hepatic lipid homeostasis in HFD-induced NAFLD by blocking oxidative stress to restore NAD(+)-depletion-mediated dysfunction of lipin 1 signaling. This study provides novel mechanistic insights into NAFLD pathogenesis and indicates that troxerutin is a candidate for pharmacological intervention of NAFLD via restoring NAD(+) levels.

24565674,High-fructose diet leads to visceral adiposity and hypothalamic leptin resistance in male rats--do glucocorticoids play a role?,"Abstract:Fructose overconsumption has been involved in the genesis and progression of the metabolic syndrome. Hypothalamus and adipose tissue, major organs for control of food intake and energy metabolism, play crucial roles in metabolic homeostasis. We hypothesized that glucocorticoid signaling mediates the effects of a fructose-enriched diet on visceral adiposity by acting on neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamus and altering adipogenic transcription factors in the visceral adipose tissue. We analyzed the effects of 9-week consumption of 60% fructose solution on dyslipidemia, insulin and leptin sensitivity, and adipose tissue histology in male Wistar rats. Glucocorticoid signaling was assessed in both hypothalamus and visceral adipose tissue, while the levels of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and lipin-1, together with the levels of their target genes expression, were analyzed in the visceral adipose tissue. The results showed that long-term consumption of highly concentrated liquid fructose led to the development of visceral adiposity, elevated triglycerides and hypothalamic leptin resistance accompanied by stimulated glucocorticoid signaling and NPY mRNA elevation. Results from adipose tissue implied that fructose consumption shifted the balance between glucocorticoid receptor and adipogenic transcriptional factors (PPARγ, SREBP-1 and lipin-1) in favor of adipogenesis judged by distinctly separated populations of small adipocytes observed in this tissue. In summary, we propose that high-fructose-diet-induced alterations of glucocorticoid signaling in both hypothalamus and adipose tissue result in enhanced adipogenesis, possibly serving as an adaptation to energy excess in order to limit deposition of fat in nonadipose tissues.

17158099,Three mammalian lipins act as phosphatidate phosphatases with distinct tissue expression patterns,"Abstract:We previously identified mutations in the Lpin1 gene, encoding lipin-1, as the underlying cause of lipodystrophy in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mutant mouse. Lipin-1 is normally expressed at high levels in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and deficiency in the fld mouse causes impaired adipose tissue development, insulin resistance, and altered energy expenditure. We also identified two additional lipin protein family members of unknown function, lipin-2 and lipin-3. Han et al. (Han, G. S., Wu, W. I., and Carman, G. M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 9210-9218) recently demonstrated that the single lipin homolog in yeast, Smp2, exhibits phosphatidate phosphatase type-1 (PAP1) activity, which has a key role in glycerolipid synthesis. Here we demonstrate that lipin-1 accounts for all of the PAP1 activity in white and brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. However, livers of lipin-1-deficient mice exhibited normal PAP1 activity, indicating that other members of the lipin protein family could have PAP1 activity. Consistent with this possibility, recombinant lipin-2 and lipin-3 possess PAP1 activity. Each of the three lipin family members showed Mg2+-dependent activity that was specific for phosphatidate under the conditions employed. The different lipins showed distinct tissue expression patterns. Our results establish the three mammalian lipin proteins as PAP1 enzymes and explain the biochemical basis for lipodystrophy in the lipin-1-deficient fld mouse."
10644441,"Genetic, physical, and transcript map of the fld region on mouse chromosome 12","Abstract:The fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mutation is manifested in abnormalities of lipid and glucose metabolism and peripheral neuropathy. To identify the gene affected by this mutation, we generated a genetic map of the fld region on chromosome 12 by the analysis of F2 offspring from an intersubspecific cross between strains BALB/cByJ-fld and CAST/EiJ. The results localize fld to the 0.42-cM interval between the microsatellite markers D12Mit170 and D12Mit184. A contig of YACs and BACs covering the nonrecombinant genomic region has been constructed and used for the identification of genes. Expressed sequence tag mapping and exon trapping identified three transcripts within the critical interval: Ctla2b, which encodes a cysteine protease inhibitor, and mouse homologs of KIAA0188 and KIAA0575, two long human transcripts of unknown function. Expression analysis revealed that Kiaa0188 is expressed in wildtype but not in fld liver, implicating this gene as a candidate for harboring the fld mutation."
27497905,Isolation of RNA from milk somatic cells as an alternative to biopsies of mammary tissue for nutrigenomic studies in dairy ewes,"Abstract:Nutrigenomic studies of mammary lipogenesis in ruminants often rely on the use of mammary tissue (MT) collected either by biopsy or at slaughter. However, isolating RNA from milk would be a useful and cost-effective technique that may avoid distress to the animal and facilitate the collection of samples in time series experiments. This assay was therefore conducted to test the hypothesis that RNA extracted from milk somatic cells (MSC) in dairy sheep would be a feasible alternative to the performance of MT biopsies for nutrigenomic analyses. To meet this objective, 8 lactating Assaf ewes were divided in 2 groups and offered a total mixed ration without supplementation (control) or supplemented with 2.4% dry matter of fish oil, which was known not only to elicit milk fat depression but also to downregulate the expression of some candidate genes involved in mammary lipogenesis. Total RNA was extracted from MSC and biopsied MT to examine whether the potential changes in the abundance of transcripts was similarly detected with both RNA sources. Milk fatty acid profile was also analyzed by gas chromatography, and variations in mRNA abundance were determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Values of RNA integrity number were always ≥7.7. The expected and designed decrease of milk fat concentration with fish oil (-29%), was associated with a lower transcript abundance of genes coding for enzymes involved in fatty acid activation (ACSS1), de novo synthesis (ACACA and FASN), uptake from plasma lipids (LPL), and esterification of fatty acids to glycerol (LPIN1), as well as of a transcription factor that may regulate their expression (INSIG1). Stable mRNA levels were showed in other candidate genes, such as FABP3, GPAT4, or SCD. Changes due to the dietary treatment were similarly detected with both RNA sources (MSC and MT biopsies), which supports the initial hypothesis and would validate the use of milk as an alternative RNA source for nutrigenomic analyses in dairy sheep.               Keywords:                    RNA source; fatty acid; fish oil; gene expression; sheep."
23426360,Phosphorylation of lipin 1 and charge on the phosphatidic acid head group control its phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity and membrane association,"Abstract:The lipin gene family encodes a class of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatases involved in the de novo synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides. Unlike other enzymes in the Kennedy pathway, lipins are not integral membrane proteins, and they need to translocate from the cytosol to intracellular membranes to participate in glycerolipid synthesis. The movement of lipin 1 within the cell is closely associated with its phosphorylation status. Although cellular analyses have demonstrated that highly phosphorylated lipin 1 is enriched in the cytosol and dephosphorylated lipin 1 is found on membranes, the effects of phosphorylation on lipin 1 activity and binding to membranes has not been recapitulated in vitro. Herein we describe a new biochemical assay for lipin 1 using mixtures of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylethanolamine that reflects its physiological activity and membrane interaction. This depends on our observation that lipin 1 binding to PA in membranes is highly responsive to the electrostatic charge of PA. The studies presented here demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates the ability of the polybasic domain of lipin 1 to recognize di-anionic PA and identify mTOR as a crucial upstream signaling component regulating lipin 1 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate how phosphorylation of lipin 1 together with pH and membrane phospholipid composition play important roles in the membrane association of lipin 1 and thus the regulation of its enzymatic activity."
36873737,Construction of a Novel Diagnostic Model Based on Ferroptosis-Related Genes for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Machine and Deep Learning Methods,"Abstract:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most general malignant tumors. Ferroptosis, a type of necrotic cell death that is oxidative and iron-dependent, has a strong correlation with the development of tumors and the progression of cancer. The present study was designed to identify potential diagnostic Ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) using machine learning. From GEO datasets, two publicly available gene expression profiles (GSE65372 and GSE84402) from HCC and nontumor tissues were retrieved. The GSE65372 database was used to screen for FRGs with differential expression between HCC cases and nontumor specimens. Following this, a pathway enrichment analysis of FRGs was carried out. In order to locate potential biomarkers, an analysis using the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) model and the LASSO regression model were carried out. The levels of the novel biomarkers were validated further using data from the GSE84402 dataset and the TCGA datasets. In this study, 40 of 237 FRGs exhibited a dysregulated level between HCC specimens and nontumor specimens from GSE65372, including 27 increased and 13 decreased genes. The results of KEGG assays indicated that the 40 differential expressed FRGs were mainly enriched in the longevity regulating pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, the mTOR signaling pathway, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Subsequently, HSPB1, CDKN2A, LPIN1, MTDH, DCAF7, TRIM26, PIR, BCAT2, EZH2, and ADAMTS13 were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers. ROC assays confirmed the diagnostic value of the new model. The expression of some FRGs among 11 FRGs was further confirmed by the GSE84402 dataset and TCGA datasets. Overall, our findings provided a novel diagnostic model using FRGs. Prior to its application in a clinical context, there is a need for additional research to evaluate the diagnostic value for HCC."
26089547,Rapidly elevated levels of PGC-1α-b protein in human skeletal muscle after exercise: exploring regulatory factors in a randomized controlled trial,"Abstract:Individuals with high skeletal muscle mitochondrial content have a lower risk to acquire cardiovascular and metabolic disease, obesity, and type II diabetes. Regular endurance training increases mitochondrial density through a complex network of transcriptional regulators that in an accumulated way are affected by each single exercise bout. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a single exercise bout on the levels of PGC-1α and related regulatory factors important for the initial phase of skeletal muscle adaptation. Ten men and ten women were randomized to either an exercise group (60 min cycling at a work load corresponding to 70% of peak oxygen uptake) or a nonexercising control group. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken before, at 30 min, and at 2, 6, and 24 h after the intervention. Twenty-two mRNA transcripts and five proteins were measured. With exercise, protein levels of PGC-1α-ex1b increased, and this elevation occurred before that of total PGC-1α protein. We also demonstrated the existence and postexercise expression pattern of two LIPIN-1 (LIPIN-1α and LIPIN-1β) and three NCoR1 (NCoR1-1, NCoR1-2, and NCoR1-3) isoforms in human skeletal muscle. The present study contributes new insights into the initial signaling events following a single bout of exercise and emphasizes PGC-1α-ex1b as the most exercise-responsive PGC-1α isoform.               Keywords:                    endurance exercise; exercise adaptation; gene expression; mitochondria; transcription."
22134922,Nuclear envelope phosphatase 1-regulatory subunit 1 (formerly TMEM188) is the metazoan Spo7p ortholog and functions in the lipin activation pathway,"Abstract:Lipin-1 catalyzes the formation of diacylglycerol from phosphatidic acid. Lipin-1 mutations cause lipodystrophy in mice and acute myopathy in humans. It is heavily phosphorylated, and the yeast ortholog Pah1p becomes membrane-associated and active upon dephosphorylation by the Nem1p-Spo7p membrane complex. A mammalian ortholog of Nem1p is the C-terminal domain nuclear envelope phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1, formerly ""dullard""), but its Spo7p-like partner is unknown, and the need for its existence is debated. Here, we identify the metazoan ortholog of Spo7p, TMEM188, renamed nuclear envelope phosphatase 1-regulatory subunit 1 (NEP1-R1). CTDNEP1 and NEP1-R1 together complement a nem1Δspo7Δ strain to block endoplasmic reticulum proliferation and restore triacylglycerol levels and lipid droplet number. The two human orthologs are in a complex in cells, and the amount of CTDNEP1 is increased in the presence of NEP1-R1. In the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, expression of nematode CTDNEP1 and NEP1-R1, as well as lipin-1, is required for normal nuclear membrane breakdown after zygote formation. The expression pattern of NEP1-R1 and CTDNEP1 in human and mouse tissues closely mirrors that of lipin-1. CTDNEP1 can dephosphorylate lipins-1a, -1b, and -2 in human cells only in the presence of NEP1-R1. The nuclear fraction of lipin-1b is increased when CTDNEP1 and NEP1-R1 are co-expressed. Therefore, NEP1-R1 is functionally conserved from yeast to humans and functions in the lipin activation pathway."
28096887,Thylakoids reduce body fat and fat cell size by binding to dietary fat making it less available for absorption in high-fat fed mice,"Abstract                        Background:                    Dietary thylakoids derived from spinach have beneficial effects on body fat accumulation and blood lipids as demonstrated in humans and rodents. Important mechanisms established include delayed fat digestion in the intestine, without causing steatorrhea, and increased fatty acid oxidation in intestinal cells. The objective of our study was to elucidate if increased fecal fat excretion is an important mechanism to normalize adipose tissue metabolism during high-fat feeding in mice supplemented with thylakoids.              Methods:                    Mice were randomized to receive HFD or thylHFD for 14 days (n = 14 for the control group and 16 for the thylakoid group). The effect of thylakoids on body fat distribution, faecal and liver fat content, and adipose tissue metabolism was investigated following high-fat feeding.              Results:                    Thylakoid supplementation for 14 days caused an increased faecal fat content without compensatory eating compared to control. As a result, thylakoid treated animals had reduced fat mass depots and reduced liver fat accumulation compared to control. The size distribution of adipocytes isolated from visceral adipose tissue was narrowed and the cell size decreased. Adipocytes isolated from thylakoid-treated mice displayed a significantly increased lipogenesis, and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), down-stream target FAS, as well as transcription factor coactivators PGC1-α and LPIN-1 were upregulated in adipose tissue from thylakoid-fed mice.              Conclusions:                    Together, these data suggest that thylakoid supplementation reduces body fat and fat cell size by binding to dietary fat and increasing its fecal excretion, thus reducing dietary fat available for absorption.

24558042,"Conserved residues in the N terminus of lipin-1 are required for binding to protein phosphatase-1c, nuclear translocation, and phosphatidate phosphatase activity","Abstract:Lipin-1 is a phosphatidate phosphatase in glycerolipid biosynthesis and signal transduction. It also serves as a transcriptional co-regulator to control lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. These functions are controlled partly by its subcellular distribution. Hyperphosphorylated lipin-1 remains sequestered in the cytosol, whereas hypophosphorylated lipin-1 translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP-1c) is a major protein dephosphorylation enzyme. Its activity is controlled by interactions with different regulatory proteins, many of which contain conserved RVXF binding motifs. We found that lipin-1 binds to PP-1cγ through a similar HVRF binding motif. This interaction depends on Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) and is competitively inhibited by (R/H)VXF-containing peptides. Mutating the HVRF motif in the highly conserved N terminus of lipin-1 greatly decreases PP-1cγ interaction. Moreover, mutations of other residues in the N terminus of lipin-1 also modulate PP-1cγ binding. PP-1cγ binds poorly to a phosphomimetic mutant of lipin-1 and binds well to the non-phosphorylatable lipin-1 mutant. This indicates that lipin-1 is dephosphorylated before PP-1cγ binds to its HVRF motif. Importantly, mutating the HVRF motif also abrogates the nuclear translocation and phosphatidate phosphatase activity of lipin-1. In conclusion, we provide novel evidence of the importance of the lipin-1 N-terminal domain for its catalytic activity, nuclear localization, and binding to PP-1cγ.

22586274,NF-E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) serves as a novel regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism through regulation of the Lipin1 and PGC-1β genes,"Abstract:Hepatic lipid metabolism is under elaborate regulation, and perturbations in this regulatory process at the transcriptional level lead to pathological conditions. NF-E2-related factor 1 (Nrf1) is a member of the cap'n'collar (CNC) transcription factor family. Hepatocyte-specific Nrf1 gene conditional-knockout mice are known to develop hepatic steatosis, but it remains unclear how Nrf1 contributes to the lipid homeostasis. Therefore, in this study we examined the gene expression profiles of Nrf1-deficient mouse livers. A pathway analysis based on the profiling results revealed that the levels of expression of the genes related to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial respiratory function were decreased in Nrf1-deficient mouse livers, indicating the profound effects that the Nrf1 deficiency conferred to various metabolic pathways. We discovered that the Nrf1 deficiency leads to the reduced expression of the transcriptional coactivator genes Lipin1 and PGC-1β (for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1β). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Nrf1 binds to the antioxidant response elements (AREs) in regulatory regions of the Lipin1 and PGC-1β genes and the binding of Nrf1 to the AREs activates reporter gene transcription. These results thus identified Nrf1 to be a novel regulator of the Lipin1 and PGC-1β genes, providing new insights into the Nrf1 function in hepatic lipid metabolism."
16357106,Cross-species analyses implicate Lipin 1 involvement in human glucose metabolism,"Abstract:Recent studies in the mouse have demonstrated that variations in lipin expression levels in adipose tissue have marked effects on adipose tissue mass and insulin sensitivity. In the mouse, lipin deficiency prevents normal adipose tissue development, resulting in lipodystrophy and insulin resistance, whereas excess lipin levels promote fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity. Here, we investigated the effects of genetic variation in lipin levels on glucose homeostasis across species by analyzing lipin transcript levels in human and mouse adipose tissues. A strong negative correlation was observed between lipin mRNA levels and fasting glucose and insulin levels, as well as an indicator of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), in both mice and humans. We subsequently analyzed the allelic diversity of the LPIN1 gene in dyslipidemic Finnish families, as well as in a case-control sample of obese (n = 477) and lean (n = 821) individuals. Alleles were defined by genotyping seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the critical DNA region over the LPIN1 gene. Intragenic SNPs and corresponding allelic haplotypes exhibited associations with serum insulin levels and body mass index (P = 0.002-0.04). Both the expression levels in adipose tissue across species and genetic data in human study samples highlight the importance of lipin in glucose homeostasis and imply that allelic variants of this gene have significance in human metabolic traits."
33013449,"Alcohol and Liver Clock Disruption Increase Small Droplet Macrosteatosis, Alter Lipid Metabolism and Clock Gene mRNA Rhythms, and Remodel the Triglyceride Lipidome in Mouse Liver","Abstract:Heavy alcohol drinking dysregulates lipid metabolism, promoting hepatic steatosis - the first stage of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). The molecular circadian clock plays a major role in synchronizing daily rhythms in behavior and metabolism and clock disruption can cause pathology, including liver disease. Previous studies indicate that alcohol consumption alters liver clock function, but the impact alcohol or clock disruption, or both have on the temporal control of hepatic lipid metabolism and injury remains unclear. Here, we undertook studies to determine whether genetic disruption of the liver clock exacerbates alterations in lipid metabolism and worsens steatosis in alcohol-fed mice. To address this question, male liver-specific Bmal1 knockout (LKO) and flox/flox (Fl/Fl) control mice were fed a control or alcohol-containing diet for 5 weeks. Alcohol significantly dampened diurnal rhythms of mRNA levels in clock genes Bmal1 and Dbp, phase advanced Nr1d1/REV-ERBα, and induced arrhythmicity in Clock, Noct, and Nfil3/E4BP4, with further disruption in livers of LKO mice. Alcohol-fed LKO mice exhibited higher plasma triglyceride (TG) and different time-of-day patterns of hepatic TG and macrosteatosis, with elevated levels of small droplet macrosteatosis compared to alcohol-fed Fl/Fl mice. Diurnal rhythms in mRNA levels of lipid metabolism transcription factors (Srebf1, Nr1h2, and Ppara) were significantly altered by alcohol and clock disruption. Alcohol and/or clock disruption significantly altered diurnal rhythms in mRNA levels of fatty acid (FA) synthesis and oxidation (Acaca/b, Mlycd, Cpt1a, Fasn, Elovl5/6, and Fads1/2), TG turnover (Gpat1, Agpat1/2, Lpin1/2, Dgat2, and Pnpla2/3), and lipid droplet (Plin2/5, Lipe, Mgll, and Abdh5) genes, along with protein abundances of p-ACC, MCD, and FASN. Lipidomics analyses showed that alcohol, clock disruption, or both significantly altered FA saturation and remodeled the FA composition of the hepatic TG pool, with higher percentages of several long and very long chain FA in livers of alcohol-fed LKO mice. In conclusion, these results show that the liver clock is important for maintaining temporal control of hepatic lipid metabolism and that disrupting the liver clock exacerbates alcohol-related hepatic steatosis.

21953514,Regulation of hepatic lipin-1 by ethanol: role of AMP-activated protein kinase/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 signaling in mice,"Abstract:Lipin-1 is a protein that exhibits dual functions as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase enzyme in the triglyceride synthesis pathways and a transcriptional coregulator. Our previous studies have shown that ethanol causes fatty liver by activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and inhibition of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in mice. Here, we tested the hypothesis that AMPK-SREBP-1 signaling may be involved in ethanol-mediated up-regulation of lipin-1 gene expression. The effects of ethanol on lipin-1 were investigated in cultured hepatic cells and in the livers of chronic ethanol-fed mice. Ethanol exposure robustly induced activity of a mouse lipin-1 promoter, promoted cytoplasmic localization of lipin-1, and caused excess lipid accumulation, both in cultured hepatic cells and in mouse livers. Mechanistic studies showed that ethanol-mediated induction of lipin-1 gene expression was inhibited by a known activator of AMPK or overexpression of a constitutively active form of AMPK. Importantly, overexpression of the processed nuclear form of SREBP-1c abolished the ability of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside to suppress ethanol-mediated induction of lipin-1 gene-expression level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further revealed that ethanol exposure significantly increased the association of acetylated histone H3 at lysine 9 with the SRE-containing region in the promoter of the lipin-1 gene.              Conclusion:                    In conclusion, ethanol-induced up-regulation of lipin-1 gene expression is mediated through inhibition of AMPK and activation of SREBP-1."
31783151,Lipidomic analysis of human primary hepatocytes following LXR activation with GW3965 identifies AGXT2L1 as a main target associated to changes in phosphatidylethanolamine,"Abstract:Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists have the potential to alleviate obesity related diseases, particularly atherosclerosis. However, LXRs are transcriptional regulators that induce de novo lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes which represents a serious adverse effect. In this work, we sought to characterize the LXR agonist GW3965 effects on fatty acid (FA) and phospholipid (PL) remodelling and the correlation with gene expression in order to better understand the underlying effects leading to hepatic pathology upon LXR activation. Human primary hepatocytes treated for 48 h with GW3965 were analysed for changes in lipid metabolism gene expression by qPCR, variations in the FA profile was evaluated by GC-FID and in PL profiles using thin layer chromatography, ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis. Changes in cell membrane biochemical properties were studied using bilayer models generated with CHARMM-GUI. ELOLV6 and SCD1 mRNA increase was consistent with higher C16:1 and C18:1n9 at the expense of C16:0 and C18:0. The reduction of C18:2n6 and increase in C20:2n6 was in agreement with ELOVL5 upregulation. Phosphatydilethanolamine (PE) levels tended to decrease and phosphatidylinositol to increase; although differences did not reach significance, they correlated with changes in AGXT2L1, CDS1 and LPIN1 mRNA levels that were increased. The overall effect of GW3965 on PEs molecular profiles was an increase of long-chain polyunsaturated FA chains and a decrease of C16/C18 saturated and monounsaturated FAs chains. Additionally, PC (32:1) and PC (34:2) were decreased, and PC (36:1) and PC (34:1) were increased. AGXT2L1 is an enzyme with strict substrate specificity for phosphoethanolamine, which is converted into ammonia in GW3965-treated hepatocytes and could explain the PE reduction. In summary, LXR activation by GW3965 targets PE biosynthesis and FA elongation/desaturation, which tends to decrease PE in relation to total PL levels, and remodelling of PC and PE molecular species. We identified the human AGXT2L1 gene as induced by LXR activation by both synthetic and endogenous agonist treatment. The increase in acetaldehyde-induced oxidative stress, and in the lipid species identified have the potential to enhance the inflammatory process and impair membrane function. Future studies should focus on inhibition of AGXT2L1 activity with the aim of reverting the steatosis induced by LXR activation.              Keywords:                    AGXT2L1; LXR; lipid biosynthesis; lipidomic; liver; molecular modelling."
20607344,Sustained upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in bovine mammary tissue with contrasting changes in milk fat synthesis and lipogenic gene networks caused by lipid supplements,"Abstract:Long-term mammary expression patterns of lipogenic gene networks due to dietary lipid remain largely unknown. Mammary tissue was biopsied for transcript profiling of 29 genes at 0, 7, and 21 days of feeding cows saturated lipid (EB100) or a blend of fish/soybean oil (FSO) to depress milk fat. Milk fat yield decreased gradually with FSO and coincided with lower molar yield of fatty acids synthesized de novo, stearic acid, and oleic acid. The PPARγ targets LPIN1 and SREBF1 along with ACSS2, ACACA, FASN, and LPL increased by day 7 of feeding EB100, but differences between diets disappeared by day 21. Expression of SCAP increased markedly over time with FSO and differed from EB100 by approximately sevenfold on day 21. Expression of THRSP decreased by day 7 with both diets and returned to basal levels by day 21. SCD expression increased linearly through 7 days and remained elevated with both diets, a likely mechanism to ensure the proper level of endogenous oleic acid via desaturation of dietary stearate (EB100) or via more SCD protein to account for the reduction in stearate supply from the rumen (FSO). Despite this response, endogenous oleate was insufficient to restore normal milk fat synthesis. Only 2 of 29 genes differed in expression between diets on day 21, suggesting that transcriptional control mechanisms regulating fat synthesis were established as early as 7 days post-feeding. Gene expression reflected vastly different physiological responses by mammary tissue to adjust its metabolism to the influx of saturated fatty acids, trans10-18:1, and/or to the lack of stearic acid."
24704230,Inflammation- and lipid metabolism-related gene network expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots of Holstein cows,"Abstract:This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of energy overfeeding on gene expression in mesenteric (MAT), omental (OAT), and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue (AT) from nonpregnant and nonlactating Holstein cows. Eighteen cows were randomly assigned to either a controlled energy [LE, net energy for lactation (NE(L)) = 1.35 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM)] or moderate energy-overfed group (HE, NE(L) = 1.62 Mcal/kg of DM) for 8 wk. Cows were then euthanized and subsamples of MAT, OAT, and SAT were harvested for transcript profiling via quantitative PCR of 34 genes involved in lipogenesis, triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, lactate signaling, hepatokine signaling, lipolysis, transcription regulation, and inflammation. The interaction of dietary energy and adipose depot was not significant for any gene analyzed except LPL, which indicated a consistent response to diet. Expression of ACACA and FASN was greater in SAT than MAT, whereas expression of SCD and ADFP were greatest in SAT, intermediate in OAT, and lowest in MAT. However, the 2 visceral depots had greater expression of THRSP, ACLY, LPL, FABP4, GPAM, and LPIN1 compared with SAT. The transcription factor SREBF1 was more highly expressed in MAT and SAT than in OAT. The expression of PNPLA2 was greater in visceral AT sites than in SAT, but other lipolysis-related genes were not differentially expressed among AT depots. Visceral AT depots had greater expression of LEP, ADIPOQ, and SAA3 compared with SAT. Moreover, MAT had greater expression than SAT of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B and IL6), IL6 receptor (IL6R), and chemokines (CCL2 and CCL5). However, TNF expression was greatest in SAT, lowest in OAT, and intermediate in MAT. Overall, results indicated that visceral AT might be more active in uptake of preformed long-chain fatty acids than SAT, whereas de novo fatty acid synthesis could make a greater contribution to the intracellular pool of fatty acids in SAT than in visceral AT. The visceral AT compared with SAT seem to have a greater capacity for expression (and potentially for secretion) of proinflammatory cytokines; thus, excessive accumulation of visceral lipid due to a long-term overfeeding energy may be detrimental to liver function and overall health of dairy cows, particularly during the transition period.              Keywords:                    gene expression; inflammation; lipogenesis; visceral adipose tissue."
26086818,"The Transcriptional Effects of PCB118 and PCB153 on the Liver, Adipose Tissue, Muscle and Colon of Mice: Highlighting of Glut4 and Lipin1 as Main Target Genes for PCB Induced Metabolic Disorders","Abstract:Epidemiological studies have associated environmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms involved in the metabolic side-effects of PCB. Our study evaluated the transcriptional effects of a subchronic exposure (gavage at Day 0 and Day 15 with 10 or 100 μmol/Kg bw) to PCB118 (dioxin-like PCB), PCB153 (non-dioxin-like PCB), or an equimolar mixture of PCB118 and PCB153 on various tissues (liver, visceral adipose tissue, muscle, and colon) in mice. Our results showed that a short-term exposure to PCB118 and/or PCB153 enhanced circulating triglyceride levels but did not affect glycemia. Among the studied tissues, we did not observe any modification of the expression of inflammation-related genes, such as cytokines or chemokines. The main transcriptional effects were observed in visceral adipose and liver tissues. We found a downregulation of lipin1 and glut4 expression in these two target organs. In adipose tissue, we also showed a downregulation of Agpat2, Slc25a1, and Fasn. All of these genes are involved in lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. In muscles, we observed an induction of CnR1 and Foxo3 expression, which may be partly involved in PCB metabolic effects. In summary, our results suggest that lipin1 and glut4, notably in adipose tissue, are the main targeted genes in PCB-induced metabolic disorders, however, further studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanisms involved."
29352517,Micro-ribonucleic acid-binding site variants of type 2 diabetes candidate loci predispose to gestational diabetes mellitus in Chinese Han women,"Abstract                        Aims/introduction:                    Emerging evidence has suggested that the genetic background of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was analogous to type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast to type 2 diabetes mellitus, the genetic studies for GDM were limited. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to extensively explore the influence of micro-ribonucleic acid-binding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus candidate loci on GDM susceptibility in Chinese.              Materials and methods:                    A total of 839 GDM patients and 900 controls were enrolled. Six micro-ribonucleic acid-binding SNPs were selected from 30 type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility loci and genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays.              Results:                    The minor allele of three SNPs, PAX4 rs712699 (OR 1.366, 95% confidence interval 1.021-1.828, P = 0.036), KCNB1 rs1051295 (OR 1.579, 95% confidence interval 1.172-2.128, P = 0.003) and MFN2 rs1042842 (OR 1.398, 95% confidence interval 1.050-1.862, P = 0.022) were identified to significantly confer higher a risk of GDM in the additive model. The association between rs1051295 and increased fasting plasma glucose (b = 0.006, P = 0.008), 3-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose (b = 0.058, P = 0.025) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (b = 0.065, P = 0.017) was also shown. Rs1042842 was correlated with higher 3-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose (b = 0.056, P = 0.028). However, no significant correlation between the other included SNPs (LPIN1 rs1050800, VPS26A rs1802295 and NLRP3 rs10802502) and GDM susceptibility were observed.              Conclusions:                    The present findings showed that micro-ribonucleic acid-binding SNPs in type 2 diabetes mellitus candidate loci were also associated with GDM susceptibility, which further highlighted the similar genetic basis underlying GDM and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

29123527,Erythropoietin Increases Myelination in Oligodendrocytes: Gene Expression Profiling Reveals Early Induction of Genes Involved in Lipid Transport and Metabolism,"Abstract:Several studies have shown that erythropoietin (EPO) has neuroprotective or neuroreparative actions on diseases of the nervous system and that improves oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination in vivo and in vitro. This study aims at investigating the early molecular mechanisms for the pro-myelinating action of EPO at the gene expression level. For this purpose, we used a differentiating OL precursor cell line, rat central glia-4 cells. Cells were differentiated or not, and then treated with EPO for 1 or 20 h. RNA was extracted and changes in the gene expression profile were assessed using microarray analysis. Experiments were performed in biological replicates of n = 4. Differentiation alone changed the expression of 11% of transcripts (2,663 out of 24,272), representing 2,436 genes, half of which were upregulated and half downregulated. At 20 h of treatment, EPO significantly affected the expression of 99 genes that were already regulated by differentiation and of 150 genes that were not influenced by differentiation alone. Analysis of the transcripts most upregulated by EPO identified several genes involved in lipid transport (e.g., Cd36) and lipid metabolism (Ppargc1a/Pgc1alpha, Lpin1, Pnlip, Lpin2, Ppard, Plin2) along with Igf1 and Igf2, growth factors known for their pro-myelinating action. All these genes were only induced by EPO and not by differentiation alone, except for Pnlip which was highly induced by differentiation and augmented by EPO. Results were validated by quantitative PCR. These findings suggest that EPO might increase remyelination by inducing insulin-like growth factors and increasing lipid metabolism.

18414419,Candidate genes for obesity revealed from a C57BL/6J x 129S1/SvImJ intercross,"Abstract                        Objective:                    To identify the genes controlling body fat, we carried out a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis using C57BL/6J (B6) and 129S1/SvImJ (129) mice, which differ in obesity susceptibility after consuming an atherogenic diet.              Methods:                    Mice were fed chow until 8 weeks and an atherogenic diet from 8 to 16 weeks; body fatness was measured by X-ray absorptiometry in 528 (B6 x 129) F(2) at 8 and 16 weeks. A high-density genome scan was performed using 508 polymorphic markers. After identifying the genetic loci, we narrowed the QTL using comparative genomics and bioinformatics.              Results:                    The percentage of body fat was significantly linked to loci on chromosomes (Chr) 1 (22, 68 and 173 Mb), 4 (74 Mb), 5 (73 Mb), 7 (88 Mb), 8 (43 and 80 Mb), 9 (55 Mb), 11 (115 Mb) and 12 (32 Mb); three suggestive loci on Chrs 6 (76 Mb), 9 (30 Mb) and 16 (26 Mb) and two pairs of interacting loci (Chr 2 at 99.8 Mb with Chr 7; Chr 1 at 68 Mb with Chr 11). Comparative genomics narrowed the QTL intervals by 20-57% depending on the chromosome; in most cases, haplotype analysis further narrowed them by about 90%.              Conclusions:                    Our analysis identified 15 QTL for percentage of body fat. We narrowed the QTL using comparative genomics and haplotype analysis and suggest several candidate genes: Apcs on Chr 1, Ppargc1a on Chr 5, Ucp1 on Chr 8, Angptl6 on Chr 9 and Lpin1 on Chr 12."
31761539,Effect of vitrification temperature and cryoprotectant concentrations on the mRNA transcriptome of bovine mature oocytes after vitrifying at immature stage,"Abstract:The present study aimed to investigate the effect of vitrification temperature (VT) and cryoprotective agent concentrations (CPAs) on the mRNA transcriptome of bovine mature oocytes after vitrifying at immature stage. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were randomly divided into the following five groups: fresh oocytes (control), oocytes vitrified in liquid helium (LHe; -269 °C) with 5.6 M CPAs (LHe 5.6 M), oocytes vitrified in LHe with 6.6 M CPAs (LHe 6.6 M), oocytes vitrified in liquid nitrogen (LN; -196 °C) with 5.6 M CPAs (LN 5.6 M), and oocytes vitrified in LN with 6.6 M CPAs (LN 6.6 M). We performed two experiments in this study. In experiment 1, after vitrification and thawing, oocytes of vitrified and control groups were subjected to in vitro maturation (IVM), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and in vitro culture (IVC). The rates of normal morphology, maturation, cleavage, and blastocyst formation in LHe 5.6 M were higher than those in LN 5.6 M (P < 0.05). The rates of normal morphology and cleavage in LHe 6.6 M were higher than those in LN 6.6 M (P < 0.05). However, the maturation and blastocyst rates were similar (P > 0.05) between LHe 6.6 M and LN 6.6 M. The blastocyst rate of 13.31% in LHe 5.6 M was the highest among all vitrified groups (P < 0.05). In experiment 2, the mRNA transcriptome of each sample was analyzed by Smart-Seq4, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected by edgeR (P ≤ 0.05; fold-change ≥ 2). A total of 505 DEGs (342 upregulated and 163 downregulated genes) were detected in LHe 5.6 M; 609 DEGs (493 upregulated and 116 downregulated genes) were detected in LHe 6.6 M; 218 DEGs (101 upregulated and 117 downregulated genes) were determined in LN 5.6 M; and 221 DEGs (104 upregulated and 117 downregulated genes) were detected in LN 6.6 M. LHe vitrification affected the mRNA transcriptome of bovine mature oocytes after vitrifying at immature stage mainly by upregulating gene expression. Decreased CPAs (5.6 M) reduced the effect of vitrification on mRNA transcriptome when LHe vitrification was used. Among the DEGs closely related to bovine oocytes, the genes possibly related to VT were ND2, MPV17L2, PIF1, LPIN1, IMP3, BRD1, DCTN3, DERA, ATP7B, NEK5, HVCN1, and MARK2. The gene that may be associated with CPAs is CC2D2A. Genes that may be affected by VT and CPAs included PGK1, SLC7A3, FITM2, NPM3, ISCU, CWC15, and PSAP.

23849213,[PPARβ/δ Activation prevents hypertriglyceridemia caused by a high fat diet. Involvement of AMPK and PGC-1α-Lipin1-PPARα pathway],"Abstract                        Introduction:                    Excessive consume of hypercaloric and high in saturated fat food causes an atherogenic dyslipidemia. In this study we analyzed the effects of PPARβ/δ activator GW501516 on the hypertriglyceridemia induced by a high-fat diet.              Methods:                    Male mice were randomized in three groups: control (standard chow), high fat diet (HFD, 35% fat by weight, 58% Kcal from fat) and high fat diet plus GW501516 (3mg/Kg/day). Treatment duration was three weeks.              Results:                    HFD-induced hypertriglyceridemia was accompanied by a reduction in hepatic levels of phospho-AMPK and in PGC-1α and Lipin1 mRNA levels. All these effects were reversed by GW501516 treatment. The lack of changes in phospho-AMPK levels after GW501516 treatment in HFD-fed animals could be the result of an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. GW501516 treatment also increased Lipin1 protein levels in the nucleus, led to the amplification of the PGC-1α-PPARα pathway and increased PPARα DNA-binding activity, as well as the expression of PPARα-target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. GW501516 also increased β-hydroxibutirate plasmatic levels, a hepatic β-oxidation end product. Finally, GW501516 increased the hepatic levels of the PPARα endogenous ligand 16:0/18:1-PC and the expression of the VLDL receptor.              Conclusion:                    These data indicate that the hypotriglyceridemic effect of GW501516 in mice subjected to HFD-fed mice is accompanied by an increase in phospho-AMPK levels and the amplification of the PGC-1α-Lipin1-PPARα pathway.

22509021,Induction of microRNA-155 is TLR- and type IV secretion system-dependent in macrophages and inhibits DNA-damage induced apoptosis,"Abstract:Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen responsible for a high disease burden worldwide. Deregulated inflammatory responses, possibly involving macrophages, are implicated in H. pylori-induced pathology, and microRNAs, such as miR-155, have recently emerged as crucial regulators of innate immunity and inflammatory responses. miR-155 is regulated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in monocyte-derived cells and has been shown to be induced in macrophages during H. pylori infection. Here, we investigated the regulation of miR-155 expression in primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) during H. pylori infection and examined the downstream mRNA targets of this microRNA using microarray analysis. We report TLR2/4- and NOD1/2-independent up-regulation of miR-155, which was found to be dependent on the major H. pylori pathogenicity determinant, the type IV secretion system (T4SS). miR-155 expression was dependent on NF-κB signaling but was independent of CagA. Microarray analysis identified known gene targets of miR-155 in BMMs during H. pylori infection that are proapoptotic. We also identified and validated miR-155 binding sites in the 3' UTRs of the targets, Tspan14, Lpin1, and Pmaip1. We observed that H. pylori-infected miR-155(-/-) BMMs were significantly more susceptible to cisplatin DNA damage-induced apoptosis than were wild-type BMMs. Thus, our data suggest a function for the prototypical H. pylori pathogenicity factor, the T4SS, in the up-regulation of miR-155 in BMMs. We propose the antiapoptotic effects of miR-155 could enhance macrophage resistance to apoptosis induced by DNA damage during H. pylori infection."
16847472,Adipose tissue lipin expression levels distinguish HIV patients with and without lipodystrophy,"Abstract                        Objective:                    Lipodystrophy is the major complication of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients. Its pathophysiology is not well understood, but has been linked to antiadipogenic effects of antiretroviral drugs. Lipin represents a newly characterized protein that is critical for adipocyte differentiation, and lipin deficiency leads to lipodystrophy in the mouse. The objective of this study was to determine whether altered lipin gene expression is associated with HIV lipodystrophy in humans.              Design:                    We measured lipin mRNA levels in subcutaneous abdominal and femoral-gluteal adipose tissue biopsies from HIV-infected patients with or without lipodystrophy, and in healthy controls. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed to quantitate total lipin expression levels, and expression of two lipin isoforms (lipin-alpha and -beta) that are generated by alternative mRNA splicing.              Results:                    As predicted from studies with mice, lipin mRNA levels were correlated with limb fat mass in HIV patients, with lower lipin levels in patients with lipodystrophy than those without lipodystrophy. Unexpectedly, however, this was explained by an increase in lipin-beta expression in HIV patients without lipodystrophy compared to patients with lipodystrophy and control subjects. In addition, lipin expression levels were inversely correlated with adipose tissue expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-18, which typically increase in HIV-associated lipoatrophy.              Conclusions:                    Elevated lipin expression levels are associated both with the maintenance of greater fat mass and lower cytokine expression in HIV-infected patients. Based on the demonstrated role for lipin in promoting lipogenic gene expression, these observations raise the possibility that variations in lipin levels may contribute to variations in adipose tissue mass and function that distinguish HIV patients with and without lipodystrophy."
17612398,KIT is required for hepatic function during mouse post-natal development,"Abstract                        Background:                    The Kit gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various biological processes including melanogenesis, hematopoiesis and gametogenesis in mice and human. A large number of Kit mutants has been described so far showing the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with partial loss-of-function of the gene. Hypomorphic mutations can induce a light coat color phenotype while complete lack of KIT function interferes with embryogenesis. Interestingly several intermediate hypomorphic mutations induced in addition growth retardation and post-natal mortality.              Results:                    In this report we investigated the post-natal role of Kit by using a panel of chemically-induced hypomorphic mutations recently isolated in the mouse. We found that, in addition to the classical phenotypes, mutations of Kit induced juvenile steatosis, associated with the downregulation of the three genes, VldlR, Lpin1 and Lpl, controlling lipid metabolism in the post-natal liver. Hence, Kit loss-of-functions mimicked the inactivation of genes controlling the hepatic metabolism of triglycerides, the major source of energy from maternal milk, leading to growth and viability defects during neonatal development.              Conclusion:                    This is a first report involving KIT in the control of lipid metabolism in neonates and opening new perspectives for understanding juvenile steatosis. Moreover, it reinforces the role of Kit during development of the liver and underscores the caution that should be exerted in using KIT inhibitors during anti-cancer treatment."
28474731,A New Gene Expression Signature for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Using Frozen Fresh Tissue before Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy,"Abstract:Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer tumors. Comparisons between TNBC and non-triple negative breast cancer (nTNBC) may help to differentiate key components involved in TNBC neoplasms. The purpose of the study was to analyze the expression profile of TNBC versus nTNBC tumors in a homogeneous population from northeastern Mexico. A prospective study of 50 patients was conducted (25 TNBC and 25 nTNBC). Clinic parameters were equally distributed for TNBC and nTNBC: age at diagnosis (51 vs 47 years, p=0.1), glucose levels (107 mg/dl vs 104 mg/dl, p=0.64), and body mass index (28 vs 29, p=0.14), respectively. Core biopsies were collected for histopathological diagnosis and gene expression analyses. Total RNA was isolated and expression profiling was performed. 40 genes showed differential expression pattern in TNBC tumors. Among these, 9 over-expressed genes (PRKX/PRKY, UGT8, HMGA1, LPIN1, HAPLN3, and ANKRD11), and one under-expressed (ANX9) gene are involved in general metabolism. Based on this biochemical peculiarity, and the over-expression of BCL11A and FOXC1 (involved in tumor growth and metastasis, respectively) we validated by qPCR the expression profile of 7 genes out of the signature. In this report, a new gene signature for TNBC is proposed. To our knowledge, this is the first TNBC signature which describes genes involved in general metabolism. The findings may be pertinent for Mexican patients and require to be evaluated in further ethnic groups and populations.

16467296,The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Lipin homolog is a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase enzyme,"Abstract:Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to yield diacylglycerol and P(i). In this work, we identified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAH1 (previously known as SMP2) gene that encodes Mg(2+)-dependent PA phosphatase using amino acid sequence information derived from a purified preparation of the enzyme (Lin, Y.-P., and Carman, G. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8641-8645). Overexpression of PAH1 in S. cerevisiae directed elevated levels of Mg(2+)-dependent PA phosphatase activity, whereas the pah1Delta mutation caused reduced levels of enzyme activity. Heterologous expression of PAH1 in Escherichia coli confirmed that Pah1p is a Mg(2+)-dependent PA phosphatase enzyme and showed that its enzymological properties were very similar to those of the enzyme purified from S. cerevisiae. The PAH1-encoded enzyme activity was associated with both the membrane and cytosolic fractions of the cell, and the membrane-bound form of the enzyme was salt-extractable. Lipid analysis showed that mutants lacking PAH1 accumulated PA and had reduced amounts of diacylglycerol and its derivative triacylglycerol.ThePAH1-encoded Mg(2+)-dependent PA phosphatase shows homology to mammalian lipin, a fat-regulating protein whose molecular function is unknown. Heterologous expression of human LPIN1 in E. coli showed that lipin 1 is also a Mg(2+)-dependent PA phosphatase enzyme."
24804775,"Candidate gene association analysis for milk yield, composition, urea nitrogen and somatic cell scores in Brown Swiss cows","Abstract:The aim of this study was to investigate 96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 54 candidate genes, and test the associations of the polymorphic SNPs with milk yield, composition, milk urea nitrogen (MUN) content and somatic cell score (SCS) in individual milk samples from Italian Brown Swiss cows. Milk and blood samples were collected from 1271 cows sampled once from 85 herds. Milk production, quality traits (i.e. protein, casein, fat and lactose percentages), MUN and SCS were measured for each milk sample. Genotyping was performed using a custom Illumina VeraCode GoldenGate approach. A Bayesian linear animal model that considered the effects of herd, days in milk, parity, SNP genotype and additive polygenic effect was used for the association analysis. Our results showed that 14 of the 51 polymorphic SNPs had relevant additive effects on at least one of the aforementioned traits. Polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding factor 1 (GRLF1), prolactin receptor (PRLR) and chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) were associated with milk yield; an SNP in the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was related to fat content; SNPs in the caspase recruitment domain 15 protein (CARD15) and lipin 1 (LPIN1) affected the protein and casein contents; SNPs in growth hormone 1 (GH1), lactotransferrin (LTF) and SCD-1 were relevant for casein number; variants in beta casein (CSN2), GH1, GRLF1 and LTF affected lactose content; SNPs in beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), serpin peptidase inhibitor (PI) and SCD-1 were associated with MUN; and SNPs in acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A) were relevant in explaining the variation of SCS. Although further research is needed to validate these SNPs in other populations and breeds, the association between these markers and milk yield, composition, MUN and SCS could be exploited in gene-assisted selection programs for genetic improvement purposes."
26995140,Effects of candidate gene polymorphisms on the detailed fatty acids profile determined by gas chromatography in bovine milk,"Abstract:Association analyses between candidate genes and bovine milk fatty acids can improve our understanding of genetic variation in milk fatty acid profiles and reveal potential opportunities to tailor milk fat composition through selection strategies. In this work, we investigated the association of 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) selected from 37 candidate genes using a functional and positional approach, with 47 fatty acids, 9 fatty acid groups, and 5 Δ(9)-desaturation indices in milk samples from Brown Swiss cows. Individual milk samples were collected from 1,158 Italian Brown Swiss cows, and gas chromatography was used to obtain detailed milk fatty acid compositions. A GoldenGate assay system (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to perform genotype 96 selected SNP located in 54 genes across 22 chromosomes. In total, 51 polymorphic SNP in 37 candidate genes were retained for the association analysis. A Bayesian linear animal model was used to estimate the contribution of each SNP. A total of 129 tests indicated relevant additive effects between a given SNP and a single fatty acid trait; 38 SNP belonging to 30 genes were relevant for a total of 57 fatty acid traits. Most of the studied fatty acid traits (~81%) were relevantly associated with multiple SNP. Relevantly associated SNP were mainly found in genes related to fat metabolism, linked to or contained in previously identified quantitative trait loci for fat yield or content, or associated with genes previously identified in association analyses with milk fatty acid profiles in other cow breeds. The most representative candidate genes were LEP, PRL, STAT5A, CCL3, ACACA, GHR, ADRB2, LPIN1, STAT1, FABP4, and CSN2. In particular, relevant associations with SNP located on bovine chromosome 19 (BTA19) were found. Two candidate genes on BTA19 (CCL3 and ACACA) were relevantly associated with de novo short- and medium-chain fatty acids, likely explaining the high heritability values found for these fatty acids (with the exception of C6:0). Two additional genes on BTA19 (CCL2 and GH1) showed associations with saturated and branched-chain fatty acids. Our findings provide basic information on genes and SNP affecting the milk fatty acid composition of dairy cows. These results may support the possibility of using genetic selection to modify milk fatty acid profiles to promote beneficial health-related effects.

19880178,Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids stimulate cellular fatty acid uptake in human placental choriocarcinoma (BeWo) cells,"Abstract:Supplementation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) is advocated during pregnancy in some countries although very little information is available on their effects on placental ability to take up these fatty acids for fetal supply to which the fetal growth and development are critically dependent. To identify the roles of LCPUFAs on placental fatty acid transport function, we examined the effects of LCPUFAs on the uptake of fatty acids and expression of fatty acid transport/metabolic genes using placental trophoblast cells (BeWo). Following 24 h incubation of these cells with 100 microM of LCPUFAs (arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6, eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3, or docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3), the cellular uptake of [(14)C] fatty acids was increased by 20-50%, and accumulated fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into phospholipid fractions. Oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9), on the other hand, could not stimulate fatty acid uptake. LCPUFAs and OA increased the gene expression of ADRP whilst decreased the expression of ACSL3, ACSL4, ACSL6, LPIN1, and FABP3 in these cells. However, LCPUFAs but not OA increased expression of ACSL1 and ACSL5. Since acyl-CoA synthetases are involved in cellular uptake of fatty acids via activation for their channelling to lipid metabolism and/or for storage, the increased expression of ACSL1 and ACLS5 by LCPUFAs may be responsible for the increased fatty acid uptake. These findings demonstrate that LCPUFA may function as an important regulator of general fatty acid uptake in trophoblast cells and may thus have impact on fetal growth and development."
31212682,Nutrigenomic Effect of Saturated and Unsaturated Long Chain Fatty Acids on Lipid-Related Genes in Goat Mammary Epithelial Cells: What Is the Role of PPARγ?,"Abstract:A prior study in bovine mammary (MACT) cells indicated that long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) C16:0 and C18:0, but not unsaturated LCFA, control transcription of milk fat-related genes partly via the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). However, in that study, the activation of PPARγ by LCFA was not demonstrated but only inferred. Prior data support a lower response of PPARγ to agonists in goat mammary cells compared to bovine mammary cells. The present study aimed to examine the hypothesis that LCFA alter the mRNA abundance of lipogenic genes in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) at least in part via PPARγ. Triplicate cultures of GMEC were treated with a PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone), a PPARγ inhibitor (GW9662), several LCFA (C16:0, C18:0, t10,c12-CLA, DHA, and EPA), or a combination of GW9662 with each LCFA. Transcription of 28 genes involved in milk fat synthesis was measured using RT-qPCR. The data indicated that a few measured genes were targets of PPARγ in GMEC (SCD1, FASN, and NR1H3) while more genes required a basal activation of PPARγ to be transcribed (e.g., LPIN1, FABP3, LPL, and PPARG). Among the tested LCFA, C16:0 had the strongest effect on upregulating transcription of measured genes followed by C18:0; however, for the latter most of the effect was via the activation of PPARγ. Unsaturated LCFA downregulated transcription of measured genes, with a lesser effect by t10,c12-CLA and a stronger effect by DHA and EPA; however, a basal activation of PPARγ was essential for the effect of t10,c12-CLA while the activation of PPARγ blocked the effect of DHA. The transcriptomic effect of EPA was independent from the activation of PPARγ. Data from the present study suggest that saturated LCFA, especially C18:0, can modulate milk fat synthesis partly via PPARγ in goats. The nutrigenomic effect of C16:0 is not via PPARγ but likely via unknown transcription factor(s) while PPARγ plays an indirect role on the nutrigenomic effect of polyunsaturated LCFA (PUFA) on milk fat related genes, particularly for CLA (permitting effect) and DHA (blocking effect).              Keywords:                    LCFA; goat mammary epithelial cells; milk fat synthesis; nutrigenomics; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)."
29024632,Quantitative proteome analysis of bovine mammary gland reveals protein dynamic changes involved in peak and late lactation stages,"Abstract:Mammary gland is an important organ for milk synthesis and secretion. It undergoes dramatic physiological changes to adapt the shift from peak to late lactation stage. Protein plays a final very vital role in many life functions, and the protein changes during different lactation stages potentially reflect the biology of lactation and the functions of mammary gland in cows. In current study, we adopted tandem mass tags label-based quantitative analysis technique and to investigate proteome changes occurring in bovine mammary gland from peak to late lactation stages. A total of 3753 proteins from mammary tissues taken at two lactation points from four individual cows by biopsy were quantified, out of which 179 proteins were expressed differentially between two stages. We observed five new DEPs (AACS, DHCR7, GSTM3, SFRP1 and SFRP4) and nine functional well-studies known proteins (PLIN2, LPIN1, PLIN3, GSN, CD74, MMP2, SOD1, SOD3 and GPX3) related to milk performance and mammary morphology. Bioinformatics analyses of the DEPs showed a majority of the up-regulated proteins during late lactation stage were related to apoptosis and immune process, while the downregulated proteins were mainly involved in localization, lipid metabolic and transport process. This suggests that the mammary gland can adapt to different molecular functions according to the biological need of the animal. From the integrated analysis of the differentially expressed proteins with known quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association study data, we identified 95 proteins may potentially affect milking performance. We expect findings in this study could be a valuable resource for future studies investigating the bovine proteome and functional studies.

29846631,Rapid communication: lipid metabolic gene expression and triacylglycerol accumulation in goat mammary epithelial cells are decreased by inhibition of SREBP-1,"Abstract:In mammals, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) is the master regulator of fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis. Recent gene silencing studies in mammary cells indicate that SREBP-1 has a central role in milk fat synthesis. However, SREBP-1 knockdown studies in goat mammary cells have not been performed; hence, its direct role in controlling mRNA expression of lipid metabolism genes and triacylglycerol synthesis remains unknown. Inhibition of SREBP-1 in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) by small interference RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the content of cellular triacylglycerol (~50% decrease, P < 0.05) and was partly related to downregulation of AGPAT6, LPIN1, and DGAT2 (-23%, -28% and -19%, respectively. P < 0.05), which are key enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis, cellular triacylglycerol content and lipid droplet accumulation all decreased by SREBP-1 inhibition. The expression of lipid droplet formation and secretion genes was not altered in response to treatment. Although the lack of effect on expression of ACACA and FASN (rate-limiting enzymes for de novo fatty acid synthesis) with SREBP-1 knockdown was unexpected (P > 0.05), the downregulation of genes related to synthesis of acetyl-CoA and acetate activation (ACLY, ACSS2, and IDH1, P < 0.05) suggests that lipogenesis was inhibited. SREBP-1 knockdown also resulted in decreased expression of genes associated with fatty acid desaturation and elongation (SCD1 and ELOVL6, P < 0.05), long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) activation and transport (ACSL1, FABP3, and SLC27A6, P < 0.05). The results underscored the essential role of SREBP-1 not only in fatty acid synthesis but also in desaturation, elongation, and esterification in GMEC. Clearly, the lack of effect on ACACA and FASN, both of which are considered the key lipogenic enzymes, implies that there may be different regulatory mechanisms in goat compared with bovine mammary cells."
17105729,"Insulin controls subcellular localization and multisite phosphorylation of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase, lipin 1","Abstract:Brain, liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle from fatty liver dystrophy (fld/fld) mice, which do not express lipin 1 (lipin), contained much less Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) activity than tissues from wild type mice. Lipin harboring the fld(2j) (Gly(84) --> Arg) mutation exhibited relatively little PAP activity. These results indicate that lipin is a major PAP in vivo and that the loss of PAP activity contributes to the fld phenotype. PAP activity was readily detected in immune complexes of lipin from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where the protein was found both as a microsomal form and a soluble, more highly phosphorylated, form. Fifteen phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometric analyses. Insulin increased the phosphorylation of multiple sites and promoted a gel shift that was due in part to phosphorylation of Ser(106). In contrast, epinephrine and oleic acid promoted dephosphorylation of lipin. The PAP-specific activity of lipin was not affected by the hormones or by dephosphorylation of lipin with protein phosphatase 1. However, the ratio of soluble to microsomal lipin was markedly increased in response to insulin and decreased in response to epinephrine and oleic acid. The results suggest that insulin and epinephrine control lipin primarily by changing localization rather than intrinsic PAP activity."
18669885,Alterations in hepatic metabolism in fld mice reveal a role for lipin 1 in regulating VLDL-triacylglyceride secretion,"Abstract                        Objective:                    Lipin 1 controls fatty acid metabolism in the nucleus as a transcriptional regulator and in the cytosol as an enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step in phosphoglycerol triacylglyceride (TAG) synthesis. We sought to evaluate the effects of lipin 1 on hepatic TAG synthesis and secretion by gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches.              Methods and results:                    Rates of TAG synthesis were not impaired in hepatocytes isolated from adult lipin 1-deficient (fld) mice and were actually increased in 14-day-old fld mice. Additionally, compared to littermate controls, VLDL-TAG secretion rates were markedly increased in fld mice of both ages. Lipin 1 overexpression did not alter TAG synthesis rates but significantly suppressed VLDL-TAG secretion. The lipin 1-mediated suppression of VLDL-TAG secretion was linked to the peptide motif mediating its transcriptional-regulatory effects. However, the expression of candidate genes required for VLDL assembly and secretion was unaltered by lipin 1 activation or deficiency. Finally, the hepatic expression of lipin 1 was diminished in obese insulin-resistant mice, whereas adenoviral-mediated overexpression of lipin 1 in liver of these mice inhibits VLDL-TAG secretion and improves hepatic insulin signaling.              Conclusions:                    Collectively, these studies reveal new and unexpected effects of lipin 1 on hepatic TAG metabolism and obesity-related hepatic insulin resistance."
22118082,Dietary lipid during the transition period to manipulate subcutaneous adipose tissue peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-regulator and target gene expression,"Abstract:Objectives were to determine adipose tissue mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ co-regulators, target enzymes and transcription regulators, inflammation-related genes, and adipokines in response to dietary long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). From -21 through 10 d relative to parturition cows were fed no supplemental LCFA (control), saturated LCFA (SFAT; mainly 16:0 and 18:0), or fish oil (FO). Lipid was fed at 250 g/d prepartum or approximately 1.5 to 1.9% of the previous day's dry matter intake postpartum. Transcript profiling of 35 genes via quantitative PCR was conducted on biopsies (n=5 cows/diet) collected at -14 and 11 d from parturition. Despite lower dry matter intake with FO, pre- and postpartal blood nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and liver triacylglycerol were unaffected by treatment but increased after calving regardless of diet. Prepartal expression of adipogenic/lipogenic transcription regulators [CEBPA, CEBPB, RXRA, KLF5, and MLXIPL (formerly ChREBP)] and co-regulators (CARM1, EP300, NCOA1, MED1, NCOR2, and NRIP1) was upregulated by FO and SFAT versus control, whereas most enzymes involved in lipogenesis/triacylglycerol synthesis (FASN, SCD, DGAT2, and LPIN1) had greater expression only with FO. Expression of most adipogenic/lipogenic genes decreased after parturition, but feeding SFAT led to sustained upregulation of CEBPA, CEBPB, RXRA, several PPAR-co-activators, and DGAT2 and SCD, suggesting maintenance of a pro-adipogenic/pro-lipogenic state with SFAT. The co-activator CREBBP was greater in cows fed lipid and did not decrease after parturition, suggesting ligand activation of PPARγ. The greater peripartal expression of NFKB1 and TBK1 due to dietary lipid was suggestive of a local inflammatory response. At amounts fed prepartum, both FO and SFAT were effective in upregulating the adipose tissue PPARγ-gene network. In contrast, only SFAT led to sustaining that response. Overall, the observed expression patterns are suggestive of an adipogenic regulatory mechanism particularly responsive to SFAT."
21363937,The PPARβ/δ activator GW501516 prevents the down-regulation of AMPK caused by a high-fat diet in liver and amplifies the PGC-1α-Lipin 1-PPARα pathway leading to increased fatty acid oxidation,"Abstract:Metabolic syndrome-associated dyslipidemia is mainly initiated by hepatic overproduction of the plasma lipoproteins carrying triglycerides. Here we examined the effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-β/δ activator GW501516 on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Exposure to the HFD caused hypertriglyceridemia that was accompanied by reduced hepatic mRNA levels of PPAR-γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1)-α and lipin 1, and these effects were prevented by GW501516 treatment. GW501516 treatment also increased nuclear lipin 1 protein levels, leading to amplification in the PGC-1α-PPARα signaling system, as demonstrated by the increase in PPARα levels and PPARα-DNA binding activity and the increased expression of PPARα-target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. These effects of GW501516 were accompanied by an increase in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate levels, demonstrating enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, GW501516 increased the levels of the hepatic endogenous ligand for PPARα, 16:0/18:1-phosphatidilcholine and markedly enhanced the expression of the hepatic Vldl receptor. Interestingly, GW501516 prevented the reduction in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and the increase in phosphorylated levels of ERK1/2 caused by HFD. In addition, our data indicate that the activation of AMPK after GW501516 treatment in mice fed HFD might be the result of an increase in the AMP to ATP ratio in hepatocytes. These findings indicate that the hypotriglyceridemic effect of GW501516 in HFD-fed mice is accompanied by an increase in phospho-AMPK levels and the amplification of the PGC-1α-lipin 1-PPARα pathway."
22989885,Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (Cb1r) disrupts hepatic insulin receptor signaling via cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein H (Crebh)-mediated induction of Lipin1 gene,"Abstract:Activation of hepatic cannabinoid 1 receptor (Cb1r) signaling has been implicated in the development of phenotypes associated with fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. In the current study, we have elucidated the critical role of endoplasmic reticulum-bound transcription factor cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein H (Crebh) in mediating activated Cb1r signaling in inducing phosphatidic acid phosphatase Lipin1 gene expression and subsequently deregulating hepatic insulin receptor signaling. Cb1r agonist (2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)) treatment induced Lipin1 gene expression in a Crebh-dependent manner via recruiting CREBH to the endogenous Lipin1 gene promoter. Adenoviral overexpression of Crebh or 2-AG treatment in mice induced Lipin1 gene expression to increase the hepatic diacylglycerol (DAG) level and phosphorylation of protein kinase Cε (PKCε). This in turn inhibited hepatic insulin receptor signaling. Knockdown of Crebh or Cb1r antagonism attenuated 2-AG-mediated induction of Lipin1 gene expression and decreased DAG production in mouse liver and subsequently restored insulin receptor signaling. Similarly, knockdown of Lipin1 attenuated the 2-AG-induced increase in the DAG level and PKCε phosphorylation. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Crebh partially but significantly blunted Lipin1 expression and the DAG level in db/db mice. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which Cb1r signaling induces Lipin1 gene expression and increases DAG production by activating Crebh, thereby deregulating insulin receptor signaling pathway and lipid homeostasis."
23236470,Complex interplay between the lipin 1 and the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF4α) pathways to regulate liver lipid metabolism,"Abstract:Lipin 1 is a bifunctional protein that serves as a metabolic enzyme in the triglyceride synthesis pathway and regulates gene expression through direct protein-protein interactions with DNA-bound transcription factors in liver. Herein, we demonstrate that lipin 1 is a target gene of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), which induces lipin 1 gene expression in cooperation with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) through a nuclear receptor response element in the first intron of the lipin 1 gene. The results of a series of gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that lipin 1 coactivates HNF4α to activate the expression of a variety of genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid catabolism. In contrast, lipin 1 reduces the ability of HNF4α to induce the expression of genes encoding apoproteins A4 and C3. Although the ability of lipin to diminish HNF4α activity on these promoters required a direct physical interaction between the two proteins, lipin 1 did not occupy the promoters of the repressed genes and enhances the intrinsic activity of HNF4α in a promoter-independent context. Thus, the induction of lipin 1 by HNF4α may serve as a mechanism to affect promoter selection to direct HNF4α to promoters of genes encoding fatty acid oxidation enzymes."
11792863,Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of lipin mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin,"Abstract:The phosphorylation of a previously uncharacterized protein of apparent M(r) approximately 140,000 was found to be increased when rat adipocytes were incubated with insulin. The sequences of peptides generated by digesting the protein with trypsin matched perfectly with sequences in mouse lipin. Lipin is the product of the gene that is mutated in fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mice [Peterfy, M., Phan, J., Xu, P. & Reue, K (2001) Nat. Genet. 27, 121-124], which exhibit several phenotypic abnormalities including hyperlipidemia, defects in adipocyte differentiation, impaired glucose tolerance, and slow growth. When immunoblots were prepared with lipin antibodies, both endogenous adipocyte lipin and recombinant lipin overexpressed in HEK293 cells appeared as bands ranging in apparent M(r) from 120,000 to 140,000. Incubating adipocytes with insulin decreased the electrophoretic mobility and stimulated the phosphorylation of both Ser and Thr residues in lipin. The effects of insulin were abolished by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase, and by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamcyin (mTOR). The inhibition by rapamycin was blocked by FK506, which competitively inhibits those effects of rapamycin that are mediated by inhibition of mTOR. Moreover, amino acids, which activate mTOR, mimicked insulin by increasing lipin phosphorylation in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Thus, lipin represents a target of the mTOR pathway, and potentially links this nutrient-sensing pathway to adipocyte development."
26484979,Veterinary Medicine and Omics (Veterinomics): Metabolic Transition of Milk Triacylglycerol Synthesis in Sows from Late Pregnancy to Lactation,"Abstract:Mammalian milk is a key source of lipids, providing not only important calories but also essential fatty acids. Veterinary medicine and omics systems sciences intersection, termed as ""veterinomics"" here, has received little attention to date but stands to offer much promise for building bridges between human and animal health. We determined the changes in porcine mammary genes and proteomics expression associated with milk triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and secretion from late pregnancy to lactation. TAG content and fatty acid (FA) composition were determined in porcine colostrum (the 1st day of lactation) and milk (the 17th day of lactation). The mammary transcriptome for 70 genes and 13 proteins involved in TAG synthesis and secretion from six sows, each at d -17(late pregnancy), d 1(early lactation), and d 17 (peak lactation) relative to parturition were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. The TAG content and the concentrations of de novo synthesized FAs, saturated FAs, and monounsaturated FAs were higher in milk than in colostrum (p<0.05). Robust upregulation with high relative mRNA abundance was evident during lactation for genes associated with FA uptake (VLDLR, LPL, CD36), FA activation (ACSS2, ACSL3), and intracellar transport (FABP3), de novo FA synthesis (ACACA, FASN), FA elongation (ELOVL1), FA desaturation (SCD, FADS1), TAG synthesis (GPAM, AGPAT1, LPIN1, DGAT1), lipid droplet formation (BTN2A1, XDH, PLIN2), and transcription factors and nuclear receptors (SREBP1, SCAP, INSIG1/2). In conclusion, a wide variety of lipogenic genes and proteins regulate the channeling of FAs towards milk TAG synthesis and secretion in porcine mammary gland tissue. These findings inform future omics strategies to increase milk fat production and lipid profile and attest to the rise of both veterinomics and lipidomics in postgenomics life sciences."
27354644,Global Liver Gene Expression Analysis on a Murine Metabolic Syndrome Model Treated by Low-molecular-weight Lychee Fruit Polyphenol (Oligonol®),"Abstract                        Background/aim:                    Oligonol® (OLG) is a low-molecular-weight lychee fruit polyphenol mainly containing catechin-type monomers and oligomers of proanthocyanidins. Dietary OLG supplementation reportedly improves lipid metabolism disorder and lowers the visceral fat level in animal and human studies. Thus, we investigated the mechanism behind the protective and beneficial effects of OLG on a Western diet (WD)-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS) of a murine model.              Materials and methods:                    Using the C57BL/6J mouse for the MetS model, mice were divided into three groups: control (normal diet: ND), Western diet (WD) and WD + 0.5% OLG (OLG) groups. The WD group was fed a high-calorie (high fructose plus high fat) diet for 12 weeks to develop MetS. At week 12, all mice were sacrificed and the blood and liver were obtained for histological and biological examinations and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).              Results:                    Body weight, liver weight, plasma triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (T-Cho) and alanine aminotransferase (ATS) levels of both OLG groups were significantly lower than those of the WD group. On histological examination of the liver, the area of fatty deposits was shown to be suppressed by OLG administration. Expression gene analysis in the liver of WD- versus OLG-fed mice by RNA-Seq showed that 464/45,706 genes exhibited a significant change of expression (corrected p-value <0.05, absolute value of fold change (FC) ≥2). Gene network analysis showed that genes related to hepatic steatosis, liver inflammation and tumor invasion were inactivated in the OLG group. In particular, the lipid metabolism-related genes Lpin1, Adig and Cidea were regulated by OLG administration.              Conclusion:                    OLG may function to suppress MetS and the progression of geriatric diseases in WD-fed mice by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism, inflammation and tumor-related genes in the liver.

11138012,"Lipodystrophy in the fld mouse results from mutation of a new gene encoding a nuclear protein, lipin","Abstract:Mice carrying mutations in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) gene have features of human lipodystrophy, a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by loss of body fat, fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance. Through positional cloning, we have isolated the gene responsible and characterized two independent mutant alleles, fld and fld(2J). The gene (Lpin1) encodes a novel nuclear protein which we have named lipin. Consistent with the observed reduction of adipose tissue mass in fld and fld(2J)mice, wild-type Lpin1 mRNA is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue and is induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Our results indicate that lipin is required for normal adipose tissue development, and provide a candidate gene for human lipodystrophy. Lipin defines a novel family of nuclear proteins containing at least three members in mammalian species, and homologs in distantly related organisms from human to yeast."
19799857,Suppression of cardiac phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 1 activity and lipin mRNA expression in Zucker diabetic fatty rats and humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Abstract:Lipin functions in mammalian phospholipid biosynthesis through its phosphatidate phosphohydrolase 1 (PAP(1)) activity. Here, we studied cardiac PAP(1) activity and lipin expression ex vivo in 8-month-old Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing open heart surgery for coronary bypass grafting. Compared to non-diabetic littermates (ZDF-fa/+), left ventricular PAP(1) activity was 29% lower in diabetic ZDF-fa/fa rats. Left ventricular PAP(1) activities were 2.1-fold (ZDF-fa/fa) and 3.6-fold (ZDF-fa/+) higher than the respective atrial activities, indicating marked differences in cardiac distribution of PAP(1). PAP(1) activity was highly related with cardiac lipin-1 and lipin-3 mRNA expression in ZDF rats (r=0.99 and 0.96). Consistent with the findings in experimental animals, human atrial tissue displayed PAP(1) activity that was 33% lower in those having diabetes than in non-diabetic controls. Accordingly, atrial lipin-1 and lipin-3 mRNA expression in diabetic patients was 50% and 59% lower as in non-diabetic patients, respectively. Insulin therapy increased both PAP(1) activity and lipin mRNA expression in diabetic patients. We conclude that suppression of cardiac PAP(1) activity/lipin expression may contribute to metabolic dysfunction of the diabetic heart."
36864379,Whole-genome sequencing of cryopreserved resources from French Large White pigs at two distinct sampling times reveals strong signatures of convergent and divergent selection between the dam and sire lines,"Abstract                        Background:                    Numerous genomic scans for positive selection have been performed in livestock species within the last decade, but often a detailed characterization of the detected regions (gene or trait under selection, timing of selection events) is lacking. Cryopreserved resources stored in reproductive or DNA gene banks offer a great opportunity to improve this characterization by providing direct access to recent allele frequency dynamics, thereby differentiating between signatures from recent breeding objectives and those related to more ancient selection constraints. Improved characterization can also be achieved by using next-generation sequencing data, which helps narrowing the size of the detected regions while reducing the number of associated candidate genes.              Methods:                    We estimated genetic diversity and detected signatures of recent selection in French Large White pigs by sequencing the genomes of 36 animals from three distinct cryopreserved samples: two recent samples from dam (LWD) and sire (LWS) lines, which had diverged from 1995 and were selected under partly different objectives, and an older sample from 1977 prior to the divergence.              Results:                    French LWD and LWS lines have lost approximately 5% of the SNPs that segregated in the 1977 ancestral population. Thirty-eight genomic regions under recent selection were detected in these lines and the corresponding selection events were further classified as convergent between lines (18 regions), divergent between lines (10 regions), specific to the dam line (6 regions) or specific to the sire line (4 regions). Several biological functions were found to be significantly enriched among the genes included in these regions: body size, body weight and growth regardless of the category, early life survival and calcium metabolism more specifically in the signatures in the dam line and lipid and glycogen metabolism more specifically in the signatures in the sire line. Recent selection on IGF2 was confirmed and several other regions were linked to a single candidate gene (ARHGAP10, BMPR1B, GNA14, KATNA1, LPIN1, PKP1, PTH, SEMA3E or ZC3HAV1, among others).              Conclusions:                    These results illustrate that sequencing the genome of animals at several recent time points generates considerable insight into the traits, genes and variants under recent selection in a population. This approach could be applied to other livestock populations, e.g. by exploiting the rich biological resources stored in cryobanks."
18155511,Long-term phytosterol treatment alters gene expression in the liver of apo E-deficient mice,"Abstract:Dietary phytosterols significantly reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout (apo E-KO) mice. We investigated the long-term effects of phytosterol treatment on gene expression in the liver of these mice. Male apo E-KO mice were fed an atherogenic diet supplemented with (n=6) or without (n=6) 2% (wt/wt) phytosterol mixtures for 14 weeks. Liver specimens were collected and stored in RNAlater immediately. mRNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analyses and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for confirmation. Oligonuleotide microarray analysis of pooled samples (n=3) revealed that the expression of 132 genes/transcripts was significantly altered in treated animals, considering the false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.23. Real-time RT-PCR techniques confirmed these alterations in the expression of several of these genes, including Hmgcr (2.16-fold; P=.0002), Hmgcs1 (1.79-fold; P=.001), Hsd17b7 (2.11-fold; P=.028), Sqle (2.03-fold; P=.01), Cyp51 (1.8-fold; P=.001), Fads1 (1.55-fold; P=.031), Fads2 (2.17-fold; P=.047), Lpin1 (3.67-fold; P=.001), Ppargc1b (PGC-1beta; a coactivator of sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins; 1.66-fold; P=.007) and Cyp7B1 (1.81-fold; P=.025). In summary, our data suggest that long-term dietary phytosterols can alter the expression of a number of hepatic genes that regulate sterol metabolism in apo E-KO mice. It is possible that these changes are due to inhibition of cholesterol absorption, but are not a direct effect of plant sterols. Further multivariate correlation or association analysis is needed to establish the relations between changes in the expression of these genes and prevention of atherosclerosis by phytosterols."
19700689,Adipose tissue lipogenic gene networks due to lipid feeding and milk fat depression in lactating cows,"Abstract:Dietary lipid supplements have been extensively evaluated for their effects on mammary tissue mRNA abundance, including the classical lipogenic genes ACACA, SCD, FASN, and the transcription regulators SREBF1, THRSP, and PPARG. Novel gene isoforms with key regulatory roles in triacylglycerol synthesis have been recently identified including LPIN1 and AGPAT6. Transcriptional networks (i.e., genes whose mRNA expression is regulated by a transcription factor or nuclear receptor) coordinate adipogenesis and lipid filling in nonruminant adipose tissue. To investigate whether long-term milk fat depression affects adipogenic networks in subcutaneous adipose tissue, we characterized mRNA expression via quantitative PCR of 20 genes in cows fed saturated and polyunsaturated lipid for 3 wk. Adipose tissue from cows fed a control diet, control with fish (10 g/kg of dry matter) and soybean oil (25 g/kg of dry matter) (FSO), or control with saturated lipid (35 g/kg, EB100; Energy Booster 100, Milk Specialties, Dundee, IL) was biopsied after 21 d of feeding. Milk production did not differ across treatments (averaged 32 kg +/- 2.8 kg/d during the 21 d) but dry matter intake (DMI) decreased in cows fed FSO versus controls (averaged 18 vs. 22 kg/d during the 21 d). Despite the decrease in DMI, FSO resulted in similar energy intake as EB100 during the last 2 wk of the study. Cows fed FSO had a gradual decline in milk fat and energy yield leading to an overall 25% decrease in milk fat yield during the study (averaged 0.90 vs. 1.2 kg/d) compared with control or EB100. Thus, during the 21-d study, FSO led to a gradual increase in intake energy available for adipose tissue deposition. Relative mRNA expression of LPL and SCD as well as ADFP (coding for a protein involved in lipid droplet formation) and LPIN1 (coding for a protein involved in diacylglycerol synthesis/transcriptional regulation) was upregulated with FSO relative to other diets. Expression of the transcription regulator THRSP tended to be greater in cows fed FSO. Overall, results suggest that long-term milk fat depression caused by feeding FSO provided additional energy as well as long-chain fatty acids that, coupled with upregulation of a subset of adipogenic genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, might have resulted in greater tissue lipid deposition."
18829900,Decreased lipin 1 beta expression in visceral adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome,"Abstract                        Objective:                    In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin resistance (IR) appears with high prevalence and represents the major cause of cardiometabolic complications. Lipin 1beta regulates lipid metabolism and augments insulin sensitivity. The impact of lipin 1beta expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of PCOS patients on IR was studied for the first time.              Methods:                    Eighty-five PCOS patients and 44 controls were enrolled for subcutaneous tissue biopsy, of whom 25 patients and 30 controls also underwent visceral adipose tissue biopsy. Gene expression of lipin 1beta was measured, together with that of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Markers of obesity, IR and PCOS were also measured.              Results:                    In PCOS patients, lipin 1beta expression in both adipose depots was lower than in controls: 0.76 (0.67-0.84) vs 1.16 (0.90-1.43) for visceral and 0.91 (0.73-1.10) vs 1.30 (1.03-1.57) for s.c. depot (both P<10(-4)). The difference remained significant after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and also when comparing only lean patients with lean controls. In PCOS patients, visceral adipose lipin 1beta expression correlated negatively with homeostasis model assessment-IR (r=-0.474, P=0.017), BMI (r=-0.511, P=0.009) and waist circumference (r=-0.473, P=0.017), waist circumference remaining significant (P=0.027) in multiple regression. Subcutaneous lipin 1beta expression in PCOS correlated negatively with BMI, waist circumference and plasma triglycerides, and positively with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Subcutaneous, but not visceral lipin 1beta expression, correlated positively with the studied genes.              Conclusions:                    Lipin 1beta appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of IR in PCOS."
28131578,"mRNA abundance of genes involved in mammary lipogenesis during fish oil- or trans-10,cis-12 CLA-induced milk fat depression in dairy ewes","Abstract:Milk fat depression (MFD) caused by trans-10,cis-12 18:2 is known to be mediated in cows and ewes by downregulation of mammary lipogenic genes. However, transcriptional mechanisms underlying marine lipid-induced MFD have not been well defined yet and the few available studies in ovine are not consistent. This trial was conducted to directly compare changes in animal performance, milk fatty acid composition, and particularly mammary mRNA abundance of candidate lipogenic genes and transcription factors in response to the inclusion of fish oil or trans-10,cis-12 18:2 in the dairy sheep diet. To meet this objective, 12 lactating Assaf ewes (on average, 64 days in milk, producing 1.72 kg of milk/d with 5.17% of fat) were divided into 3 groups and offered a total mixed ration without supplementation (control) or supplemented with 2.4% dry matter of fish oil (FO treatment) or 1% dry matter of a commercial product rich in trans-10,cis-12 18:2 (CLA treatment) for 39 d. Measurements and samplings were conducted before starting the treatments and at the end of the trial. Milk samples were used for RNA extraction from somatic cells. Feed intake was not affected by lipid supplements, and as designed, reductions in milk fat concentration (-31%) were similar in the 2 treatments, although the unpredicted increase in milk production with FO counteracted the anticipated reduction in milk fat yield. Nevertheless, this did not preclude the detection of FO-induced decreases in the mRNA abundance of candidate lipogenic genes [e.g., acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and lipin 1 (LPIN1)], thus supporting the hypothesis that transcriptional regulation would be a relevant component of this type of MFD in sheep. Expected CLA-induced downregulation of some genes, such as FASN or sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), could not be detected in our samples, which might be related, at least in part, to high inter-individual variation and relatively advanced lactation stage (on average 102-103 d in milk on d 38 and 39). Overall, direct comparison of the effects of dietary FO and CLA on transcript abundance of candidate lipogenic genes and transcription factors suggest that there might be relevant differences in the transcriptional control mechanisms underlying the MFD induced by each kind of supplement (i.e., fish oil or CLA).

16303750,Genome-wide expression analysis reveals 100 adrenal gland-dependent circadian genes in the mouse liver,"Abstract:Recent progress in genome-wide expression analysis has identified hundreds of circadian genes not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the mammalian master clock) but also in peripheral tissues, such as heart, liver and kidney of mammals. Glucocorticoid is thought to be a circadian time cue for mammalian peripheral clocks. To identify the genes of which the circadian expression is regulated by endogenous glucocorticoids, we performed DNA microarray analysis using hepatic RNA from adrenalectomized (ADX) and sham-operated mice. We identified 169 genes that fluctuated between day and night in the livers of the sham-operated mice. Among these, 100 lost circadian rhythmicity in ADX mice. These included the genes for key enzymes of liver metabolic functions, such as glucokinase, HMG-CoA reductase and glucose-6-phosphatase. The circadian expression of Lpin1, FKBP51 and S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase was also abolished in the ADX mice. On the other hand, although the circadian expression of clock or clock-related genes, such as mPer2, DBP, E4BP4, mDec1, Usp2 and Wee1 remained almost totally intact in the liver of ADX mice, it was extremely damped in homozygous Clock mutant mice. The present findings suggested that one type of hepatic circadian genes in mice is transcriptionally regulated by core components of the circadian clock, such as CLOCK and BMAL1, and that the other depends on the adrenal gland."
19208909,Accelerated postnatal growth increases lipogenic gene expression and adipocyte size in low-birth weight mice,"Abstract                        Objective:                    To characterize the hormonal milieu and adipose gene expression in response to catch-up growth (CUG), a growth pattern associated with obesity and diabetes risk, in a mouse model of low birth weight (LBW).              Research design and methods:                    ICR mice were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5-18.5, reducing offspring birth weight by 25%. During the suckling period, dams were either fed ad libitum, permitting CUG in offspring, or food restricted, preventing CUG. Offspring were killed at age 3 weeks, and gonadal fat was removed for RNA extraction, array analysis, RT-PCR, and evaluation of cell size and number. Serum insulin, thyroxine (T4), corticosterone, and adipokines were measured.              Results:                    At age 3 weeks, LBW mice with CUG (designated U-C) had body weight comparable with controls (designated C-C); weight was reduced by 49% in LBW mice without CUG (designated U-U). Adiposity was altered by postnatal nutrition, with gonadal fat increased by 50% in U-C and decreased by 58% in U-U mice (P < 0.05 vs. C-C mice). Adipose expression of the lipogenic genes Fasn, AccI, Lpin1, and Srebf1 was significantly increased in U-C compared with both C-C and U-U mice (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial DNA copy number was reduced by >50% in U-C versus U-U mice (P = 0.014). Although cell numbers did not differ, mean adipocyte diameter was increased in U-C and reduced in U-U mice (P < 0.01).              Conclusions:                    CUG results in increased adipose tissue lipogenic gene expression and adipocyte diameter but not increased cellularity, suggesting that catch-up fat is primarily associated with lipogenesis rather than adipogenesis in this murine model."
17971454,The cellular functions of the yeast lipin homolog PAH1p are dependent on its phosphatidate phosphatase activity,"Abstract:The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAH1-encoded Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1, 3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidate to yield diacylglycerol and Pi. This enzyme plays a major role in the synthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in S. cerevisiae. PAP1 contains the DXDX(T/V) catalytic motif (DIDGT at residues 398-402) that is shared by the mammalian fat-regulating protein lipin 1 and the superfamily of haloacid dehalogenase-like proteins. The yeast enzyme also contains a conserved glycine residue (Gly80) that is essential for the fat-regulating function of lipin 1 in a mouse model. In this study, we examined the roles of the putative catalytic motif and the conserved glycine for PAP1 activity by a mutational analysis. The PAP1 activities of the D398E and D400E mutant enzymes were reduced by >99.9%, and the activity of the G80R mutant enzyme was reduced by 98%. The mutant PAH1 alleles whose products lacked PAP1 activity were nonfunctional in vivo and failed to complement the pah1Delta mutant phenotypes of temperature sensitivity, respiratory deficiency, nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane expansion, derepression of INO1 expression, and alterations in lipid composition. These results demonstrated that the PAP1 activity of the PAH1 gene product is essential for its roles in lipid metabolism and cell physiology."
26446033,Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids and the Pro12Ala polymorphisms of PPARG regulate serum lipids through divergent pathways: a randomized crossover clinical trial,"Abstract:Human and animal studies suggest an interaction between the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARG and dietary fat. In this randomized crossover clinical trial, we investigated whether subjects with the Pro12Pro and Ala12Ala genotypes of PPARG respond differently to a diet supplemented with high saturated (SAFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA).We recruited non-diabetic men from a population-based METSIM study (including 10,197 men) to obtain men with the Ala12Ala and the Pro12Pro genotypes matched for age and body mass index. Seventeen men with the Pro12Pro genotype and 14 with the Ala12Ala genotype were randomized to both a PUFA diet and a SAFA diet for 8 weeks in a crossover setting. Serum lipids and adipose tissue mRNA expression were measured during the diet intervention. At baseline, subjects with the Ala12Ala genotype had higher levels of HDL cholesterol and lower levels of LDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B compared to those subjects with the Pro12Pro genotype (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.1). The Ala12Ala genotype also associated with higher mRNA expression of PPARG2, LPIN1, and SREBP-1c compared to participants with the Pro12Pro genotype (FDR < 0.001). On the other hand, PUFA diet resulted in lower levels of fasting glucose, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.1) but did not affect PPARG2 mRNA expression in adipose tissue. We conclude that individuals with the Pro12Pro genotype, with higher triglyceride levels at baseline, are more likely to benefit from the PUFA diet. However, the beneficial effects of dietary PUFA and the Ala12Ala genotype of PPARG on serum lipids are mediated through divergent mechanisms.

30343921,"Effect of diets supplemented with starch and corn oil, marine algae, or hydrogenated palm oil on mammary lipogenic gene expression in cows and goats: A comparative study","Abstract:A direct comparison of cow and goat performance and milk fatty acid (FA) responses to diets that either induce milk fat depression or increase milk fat content in cows suggests species-specific regulation of lipid metabolism, including mammary lipogenesis. This experiment was conducted to highlight potential mechanisms responsible for the differences in mammary lipogenesis due to diet and ruminant species. Twelve Holstein cows and 12 Alpine goats were fed a basal diet containing no additional lipid (CTL) or a similar diet supplemented with corn oil [5% dry matter intake (DMI)] and wheat starch (COS), marine algae powder (MAP; 1.5% DMI), or hydrogenated palm oil (HPO; 3% DMI), according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28-d experimental periods. Milk yield, milk composition, FA profile, and secretions were measured. On d 27 of each experimental period, the mRNA abundance of 21 genes involved in lipid metabolism or enzyme activities or both were measured in mammary tissue sampled by biopsy. The results showed significant differences in the milk fat response of cows and goats to the dietary treatments. In cows, fat content was lowered by COS (-45%) and MAP (-22%) and increased by HPO (+13%) compared with CTL, and in goats only MAP had an effect compared with CTL, with a decrease of 15%. In both species, COS and MAP lowered the yields (mmol/d per kilogram of body weight) of <C16 and C16 FA. With COS, this decrease was compensated by an increase of >C16 FA in goats but not in cows, and the >C16 FA yield decreased with MAP in both species. Supplementation of HPO increased the yield of milk C16 FA (mmol/d per kilogram of body weight) in cows. These variations in milk fat content and FA secretion were not associated with modifications in the mammary expression of 21 genes involved in major lipid pathways, except for 3 transcription factors: PPARA, INSIG1, and SP1. This absence of large changes might be due to post-transcriptional regulation of these genes and related to the time of sampling of the mammary tissue relative to the previous meal and milking or to differences in the availability of substrate for the corresponding proteins. However, the abundance of 14 mRNA among the 21 encoding for genes studied in the mammary gland was significantly different among species, with 5 more abundant in cows (FADS3, ACSL1, PPARA, LXRA, and PPARG1) and 10 more abundant in goats (FASN, CD36, FABP3, LPL, GPAM, LPIN1, CSN2, MFGE8, and INSIG1). These species specificities of mammary lipid metabolism require further investigation.

21104868,Patterns of gene expression in muscle and fat in tumor-bearing rats: effects of CRF2R agonist on cachexia,"Abstract:The hypothesis we tested was that administering corticotropin-releasing factor receptor agonists preserves muscle mass during cancer that is related to changes in tissue gene expression. cDNA microarrays were used to compare mRNAs from muscle and adipose tissues of non-treated and agonist-treated tumor-bearing rats. In muscle of non-tumor-bearing agonist-treated animals we observed decreased expression of genes associated with fatty acid uptake and esterification. In tumor-bearing animals, CRF2R agonist administration produced decreased mRNA content of the atrogene lipin-1. In white adipose tissue, agonist treatment of non-tumor-bearing animals induced genes typically related to muscle structure and function. The fact that this treatment decreased expression of atrogenes could have clinical application. In addition, agonist treatment changed the gene pattern of adipose tissue to render it similar to that of skeletal muscle; thus, treatment with this agonist alters the gene pattern to what could be called ""muscularization of white adipose tissue."""
15123608,Lipin expression preceding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma is critical for adipogenesis in vivo and in vitro,"Abstract:We recently identified mutations in the lipin gene, Lpin1, as the cause of lipodystrophy in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse. Here we identify impaired adipocyte differentiation as the basis for lipodystrophy in lipin-deficient mice and demonstrate that lipin is required for normal induction of the adipogenic gene transcription program. We found that the reduced adiposity in chow fed fld mice and resistance to obesity in fld mice fed a high-fat diet is associated with reduced adipogenic gene expression. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from fld mice, we confirmed that lipin deficiency prevents normal lipid accumulation and induction of key adipogenic genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha. However, our previous studies of daily gene expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes indicated that lipin expression is undetectable until about day 3 of differentiation, at a point after PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha gene expression is established. This paradox was resolved by examining gene expression at 10-h intervals during 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, leading to detection of transient lipin expression at 10 h into the differentiation program, prior to the induction of PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha. Consistent with a requirement for lipin expression upstream of PPARgamma, differentiation of lipin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts could be rescued by ectopic expression of PPARgamma. Thus, we conclude that lipin expression is required prior to PPARgamma during adipocyte differentiation."
23052097,"Genomic and metabolic responses to methionine-restricted and methionine-restricted, cysteine-supplemented diets in Fischer 344 rat inguinal adipose tissue, liver and quadriceps muscle","Abstract                        Background/aims:                    Methionine restriction (MR) is a dietary intervention that increases lifespan, reduces adiposity and improves insulin sensitivity. These effects are reversed by supplementation of the MR diet with cysteine (MRC). Genomic and metabolomic studies were conducted to identify potential mechanisms by which MR induces favorable metabolic effects, and that are reversed by cysteine supplementation.              Methods:                    Gene expression was examined by microarray analysis and TaqMan quantitative PCR. Levels of selected proteins were measured by Western blot and metabolic intermediates were analyzed by mass spectrometry.              Results:                    MR increased lipid metabolism in inguinal adipose tissue and quadriceps muscle while it decreased lipid synthesis in liver. In inguinal adipose tissue, MR not only caused the transcriptional upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis but also of Lpin1, Pc, Pck1 and Pdk1, genes that are associated with glyceroneogenesis. MR also upregulated lipolysis-associated genes in inguinal fat and led to increased oxidation in this tissue, as suggested by higher levels of methionine sulfoxide and 13-HODE + 9-HODE compared to control-fed (CF) rats. Moreover, MR caused a trend toward the downregulation of inflammation-associated genes in inguinal adipose tissue. MRC reversed most gene and metabolite changes induced by MR in inguinal adipose tissue, but drove the expression of Elovl6, Lpin1, Pc, and Pdk1 below CF levels. In liver, MR decreased levels of a number of long-chain fatty acids, glycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate corresponding with the gene expression data. Although MR increased the expression of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism, levels of glycolytic intermediates were below CF levels. MR, however, stimulated gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in liver tissue. As previously reported, sulfur amino acids derived from methionine were decreased in liver by MR, but homocysteine levels were elevated. Increased liver homocysteine levels by MR were associated with decreased cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) protein levels and lowered vitamin B6 and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MeTHF) content. Finally, MR upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) gene and protein levels in both liver and adipose tissues. MRC reversed some of MR's effects in liver and upregulated the transcription of genes associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis such as Cxcl16, Cdh17, Mmp12, Mybl1, and Cav1 among others. In quadriceps muscle, MR upregulated lipid metabolism-associated genes and increased 3-hydroxybutyrate levels suggesting increased fatty acid oxidation as well as stimulation of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in this tissue.              Conclusion:                    Increased lipid metabolism in inguinal adipose tissue and quadriceps muscle, decreased triglyceride synthesis in liver and the downregulation of inflammation-associated genes are among the factors that could favor the lean phenotype and increased insulin sensitivity observed in MR rats."
24704238,Overfeeding energy upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ-controlled adipogenic and lipolytic gene networks but does not affect proinflammatory markers in visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots of Holstein cows,"Abstract:Our objective was to determine the effects of overfeeding energy on gene expression in mesenteric (MAT), omental (OAT), and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue (AT) from nonpregnant and nonlactating Holstein cows. Eighteen cows were randomly assigned to either a low energy [LE, net energy for lactation (NE(L)) = 1.35 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM)] or high energy (HE, NE(L) = 1.62 Mcal/kg of DM) diets for 8 wk. Cows were then euthanized and subsamples of MAT, OAT, and SAT were harvested for transcript profiling via quantitative PCR of 34 genes involved in lipogenesis, triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, lipolysis, lactate signaling, transcription regulation, and inflammation. The interaction of dietary energy and AT depot was only significant for LPL, which indicated a consistent response among the 3 sites. The expression of key genes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis (FASN) and desaturation (SCD) was upregulated by HE compared with LE. Other genes associated with those processes, such as ACLY, ACACA, ELOVL6, FABP4, GPAM, and LPIN1, were numerically upregulated by HE. The expression of lipolytic (PNPLA2 and ABHD5) genes was upregulated and the antilypolytic lactate receptor HCAR1 was downregulated with HE compared with LE. The putative transcription regulator THRSP was upregulated and the transcription regulator PPARG tended to be upregulated by HE, whereas SREBF1 was downregulated. Among adipocytokines, HE tended to upregulate the expression of CCL2, whereas IL6R was downregulated. Overall, results indicated that overfeeding energy may increase AT mass at least in part by stimulating transcription of the network encompassing key genes associated with de novo synthesis. In response to energy overfeeding, the expression of PPARG rather than SREBF1 was closely associated with most adipogenic or lipogenic genes. However, the transcriptional activity of these regulators needs to be verified to confirm their role in the regulation of adipogenesis or lipogenesis in bovine AT. Overfeeding energy also may predispose cows to greater lipolytic potential by stimulating expression of TAG hydrolysis genes while inhibiting signaling via hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor (HCAR1), which is a novel antilipolytic regulator. Our results do not support an overt inflammatory response in adipose tissues in response to an 8-wk energy overfeeding.

18930917,Lipin1 is a key factor for the maturation and maintenance of adipocytes in the regulatory network with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2,"Abstract:Lipin1 expression was induced at a late stage of differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and maintained at high levels in mature adipocytes. Knockdown of expression of lipin1 by small interfering RNA in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes almost completely inhibited differentiation into adipocytes, whereas overexpression of lipin1 accelerated adipocyte differentiation, demonstrating that lipin1 is required for adipocyte differentiation. In mature adipocytes, transfection of lipin1-small interfering RNA decreased the expression of adipocyte functional genes, indicating the involvement of lipin1 in the maintenance of adipocyte function. Lipin1 increases the transcription-activating function of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma(2) (PPAR gamma(2)) via direct physical interaction, whereas lipin1 did not affect the function of other adipocyte-related transcription factors such as C/EBP alpha, liver X-activated receptor alpha, or sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c. In mature adipocytes, lipin1 was specifically recruited to the PPAR gamma-response elements of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene, an adipocyte-specific gene. C/EBP alpha up-regulates lipin1 transcription by directly binding to the lipin1 promoter. Based on the existence of a positive feedback loop between C/EBP alpha and PPAR gamma(2), we propose that lipin1 functions as an amplifier of the network between these factors, resulting in the maintenance of high levels of the specific gene expression that are required for adipogenesis and mature adipocyte functions."
28558680,"Arginine supplementation modulates pig plasma lipids, but not hepatic fatty acids, depending on dietary protein level with or without leucine","Abstract                        Background:                    In the present study, the effect of arginine and leucine supplementation, and dietary protein level, were investigated in commercial crossbred pigs to clarify their individual or combined impact on plasma metabolites, hepatic fatty acid composition and mRNA levels of lipid sensitive factors. The experiment was conducted on fifty-four entire male pigs (Duroc × Pietrain × Large White × Landrace crossbred) from 59 to 92 kg of live weight. Each pig was randomly assigned to one of six experimental treatments (n = 9). The treatments followed a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement, providing two levels of arginine supplementation (0 vs. 1%) and three levels of basal diet (normal protein diet, NPD; reduced protein diet, RPD; reduced protein diet with 2% of leucine, RPDL).              Results:                    Significant interactions between arginine supplementation and protein level were observed across plasma lipids. While dietary arginine increased total lipids, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols in NPD, the inverse effect was observed in RPD. Overall, dietary treatments had a minor impact on hepatic fatty acid composition. RPD increased 18:1c9 fatty acid while the combination of leucine and RPD reduced 18:0 fatty acid. Arginine supplementation increased the gene expression of FABP1, which contributes for triacylglycerols synthesis without affecting hepatic fatty acids content. RPD, with or without leucine addition, upregulated the lipogenic gene CEBPA but downregulated the fat oxidation gene LPIN1.              Conclusions:                    Arginine supplementation was responsible for a modulated effect on plasma lipids, which is dependent on dietary protein level. It consistently increased lipaemia in NPD, while reducing the correspondent metabolites in RPD. In contrast, arginine had no major impact, neither on hepatic fatty acids content nor on fatty acid composition. Likewise, leucine supplementation of RPD, regardless the presence of arginine, promoted no changes on total fatty acids in the liver. Ultimately, arginine, leucine and dietary protein reduction seem to be unrelated with fatty liver development.

15226335,Coamplification of DDX1 correlates with an improved survival probability in children with MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma,"Abstract                        Purpose:                    Amplification of the MYCN oncogene at chromosome 2p24-25 identifies an aggressive subtype of human neuroblastoma with a poor clinical outcome. Differences in amplicon structure and coamplification of genes telomeric and centromeric to the MYCN oncogene have previously been described. A relevant role of gene coamplification for neuroblastoma pathogenesis remains elusive.              Patients and methods:                    We analyzed 98 primary neuroblastoma tumors with MYCN amplification for coamplification of seven additional genes at chromosome 2p24-25 (DDX1, NAG, NSE1, LPIN1, EST-AA581763, SMC6, and SDC1). Two semiquantitative multiplex polymerase chain reactions were used to obtain the amplification status of the target genes in relation to a reference gene on chromosome 2q (Inhibin-beta-b). Furthermore, mRNA expression pattern of coamplified genes in a subset of tumors was analyzed.              Results:                    Our results show that the frequency of gene coamplification on 2p24-25 in neuroblastoma is correlated directly to the physical distance to MYCN. Coamplification is correlated to an upregulated gene expression for DDX1 and NAG. Coamplification of the DDX1 gene within 400kb telomeric to MYCN identifies a subgroup of advanced stage neuroblastoma tumors with a more favorable outcome (P =.027, log-rank test). A high expression level of DDX1 is associated with a trend towards a better survival probability (P =.058, log-rank test).              Conclusion:                    Our results indicate that DDX1 coamplification correlates with a better prognosis and improved patient survival in MYCN-amplified neurobastoma."
16049017,"Alternatively spliced lipin isoforms exhibit distinct expression pattern, subcellular localization, and role in adipogenesis","Abstract:We recently identified mutations in the Lpin1 (lipin) gene to be responsible for lipodystrophy in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse strain. Previous studies revealed that lipin plays a critical role in adipogenesis, explaining the adipose-deficient phenotype of the fld mouse. In the current study, we demonstrate that alternative mRNA splicing generates two lipin isoforms, lipin-alpha and lipin-beta, which are differentially expressed during adipocyte differentiation. Lipin-alpha expression peaks at day 2 of 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, after which its levels gradually decrease. In contrast, lipin-beta expression is transiently elevated at 10 h, followed by a drop to background levels at 20 h and a gradual increase between days 2 and 6 of differentiation. The two lipin isoforms also exhibit differences in subcellular localization. Lipin-alpha is predominantly nuclear, whereas lipin-beta is primarily located in the cytoplasm of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting distinct cellular functions. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing either lipin-alpha or lipin-beta, we demonstrate functional differences between the two isoforms. Whereas lipin-alpha is required for adipocyte differentiation, the predominant effect of lipin-beta expression is the induction of lipogenic genes. In vivo, overexpression of lipin-beta specifically in mature adipocytes leads to elevated expression of lipogenic genes and adipocyte hypertrophy, confirming a role of lipin-beta in the regulation of lipogenesis. In conclusion, our data suggest that the two lipin isoforms have distinct, but complementary, functions in adipogenesis, with lipin-alpha playing a primary role in differentiation and lipin-beta being predominantly involved in lipogenesis."
26601584,Overexpression of SREBP1 (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1) promotes de novo fatty acid synthesis and triacylglycerol accumulation in goat mammary epithelial cells,"Abstract:Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1; gene name SREBF1) is known to be the master regulator of lipid homeostasis in mammals, including milk fat synthesis. The major role of SREBP1 in controlling milk fat synthesis has been demonstrated in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Except for a demonstrated role in controlling the expression of FASN, a regulatory role of SREBP1 on milk fat synthesis is very likely, but has not yet been demonstrated in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). To explore the regulatory function of SREBP1 on de novo fatty acids and triacylglycerol synthesis in GMEC, we overexpressed the mature form of SREBP1 (active NH2-terminal fragment) in GMEC using a recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad-nSREBP1), with Ad-GFP (recombinant adenovirus of green fluorescent protein) as control, and infected the GMEC for 48 h. In infected cells, we assessed the expression of 20 genes related to milk fat synthesis using real time-quantitative PCR, the protein abundance of SREBP1 and FASN by Western blot, the production of triacylglycerol, and the fatty acid profile. Expression of SREBF1 was modest in mammary compared with the other tissues in dairy goats but its expression increased approximately 30-fold from pregnancy to lactation. The overexpression of the mature form of SREBP1 was confirmed by >200-fold higher expression of SREBF1 in Ad-nSREBP1 compared with Ad-GFP. We observed no changes in amount of the precursor form of SREBP1 protein but a >10-fold increase of the mature form of SREBP1 protein with Ad-nSREBP1. Compared with Ad-GFP cells (control), Ad-nSREBP1 cells had a significant increase in expression of genes related to long-chain fatty acid activation (ACSL1), transport (FABP3), desaturation (SCD1), de novo synthesis of fatty acids (ACSS2, ACLY, IDH1, ACACA, FASN, and ELOVL6), and transcriptional factors (NR1H3 and PPARG). We observed a >10-fold increase in expression of INSIG1 but SCAP was downregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Among genes related to milk fat synthesis and lipid droplet formation, only LPIN1 and DGAT1 were upregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Compared with the Ad-GFP, the cellular triacylglycerol content was higher and the percentage of C16:0 and C18:1 increased, whereas that of C16:1, C18:0, and C18:2 decreased in Ad-nSREBP1 cells. Overall, the data provide strong support for a central role of SREBP1 in the regulation of milk fat synthesis in goat mammary cells.

12659670,Chromosomal localization of DNA amplifications in neuroblastoma tumors using cDNA microarray comparative genomic hybridization,"Abstract:Conventional comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) profiling of neuroblastomas has identified many genomic aberrations, although the limited resolution has precluded a precise localization of sequences of interest within amplicons. To map high copy number genomic gains in clinically matched stage IV neuroblastomas, CGH analysis using a 19,200-feature cDNA microarray was used. A dedicated (freely available) algorithm was developed for rapid in silico determination of chromosomal localizations of microarray cDNA targets, and for generation of an ideogram-type profile of copy number changes. Using these methodologies, novel gene amplifications undetectable by chromosome CGH were identified, and larger MYCN amplicon sizes (in one tumor up to 6 Mb) than those previously reported in neuroblastoma were identified. The genes HPCAL1, LPIN1/KIAA0188, NAG, and NSE1/LOC151354 were found to be coamplified with MYCN. To determine whether stage IV primary tumors could be further subclassified based on their genomic copy number profiles, hierarchical clustering was performed. Cluster analysis of microarray CGH data identified three groups: 1) no amplifications evident, 2) a small MYCN amplicon as the only detectable imbalance, and 3) a large MYCN amplicon with additional gene amplifications. Application of CGH to cDNA microarray targets will help to determine both the variation of amplicon size and help better define amplification-dependent and independent pathways of progression in neuroblastoma."
29031877,Individual variation of the extent of milk fat depression in dairy ewes fed fish oil: Milk fatty acid profile and mRNA abundance of candidate genes involved in mammary lipogenesis,"Abstract:Dairy ewes are less prone than cows to milk fat depression (MFD) but suffer from this syndrome when marine lipids are added to their diet to modulate milk fatty acid (FA) profile. However, there are large individual differences in MFD extent, and the reasons behind this variability are uncertain. On this basis, a study was conducted in lactating sheep to test the hypotheses that individual susceptibility to the low-fat milk condition may be explained by differences in (1) the milk concentration of some FA, particularly antilipogenic FA, or (2) the transcriptional regulation of mammary lipogenesis. For 5 wk, 15 ewes received a total mixed ration supplemented with 0 (control; n = 5) or 20 g of fish oil/kg of dry matter [10 animals selected out of 22 and divided into those showing marked (RESPON+; n = 5) or mild (RESPON-; n = 5) MFD]. Milk production and composition, including a comprehensive FA profile, were examined on 3 consecutive days before and after treatments. Candidate gene expression was also analyzed before the start of the trial and at its end using RNA isolated from milk somatic cells. According to the experimental design, the fish-oil-induced decrease in milk fat concentration was much stronger in RESPON+ (-25.4%) than in RESPON- (-7.7%). Milk from all ewes fed the supplemented diet showed rather uniform changes in the proportion of potentially healthy FA (such as cis-9,trans-11 18:2, trans-11 18:1, or 20:5n-3) and of those with confirmed or putative antilipogenic effects (e.g., cis-9 16:1, trans-10 and cis-11 18:1, trans-9,cis-11 18:2, and 10-oxo-18:0), without significant variation between RESPON+ and RESPON-. It was not possible to relate the very few exceptions to this general trend (e.g., in cis-7 16:1 and 22:6n-3) to responsiveness. Major mechanisms involved in mammary lipogenesis, specifically the uptake and de novo synthesis of FA, appeared to be unequally inhibited in ewes displaying different degrees of MFD, with molar yields of >16C FA being unaffected in RESPON-. However, this was not reflected in candidate gene expression. Supplementation with fish oil showed a tendency to lower the mRNA abundance of lipogenic genes such as ACSS2, FASN, LPIN1, FADS2, and INSIG1, but only SCD and GPAT4 tended to differ between RESPON- and RESPON+. Overall, these results offer no convincing support for the initial hypotheses, so further research must be pursued to explain the individual variation in MFD severity.

29056891,Polygala tenuifolia extract inhibits lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model and affects hepatic transcriptome and gut microbiota profiles,"Abstract:Obesity, the excessive accumulation of lipids in the body, is closely associated with many prevalent human disorders. Continued efforts to identify plant extracts that exhibit anti-obesity effects have drawn much attention. This study investigated whether a Polygala tenuifolia extract (PTE) possesses anti-obesity activity and how PTE may affect liver gene expression and gut microbiota. We used 3T3-L1 adipocytes and a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model to determine the effects of PTE on lipid accumulation. Next-generation sequencing analysis of liver gene expression and gut microbiota profiles following PTE treatment were conducted to elucidate possible mechanisms. We found that treatment of fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PTE inhibited lipid accumulation in the cells through reducing lipid formation and triglyceride content and by increasing lipase activity. No cytotoxicity was observed from the PTE treatment. After 5 weeks of treatment with PTE, the increased body weight, elevated serum triglyceride content, and liver steatosis in the high-fat diet-induced obese mice were each reduced. Liver transcriptomic analysis revealed that expression of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism was significantly altered. The low-grade chronic inflammation of obesity caused by a high-fat diet was also decreased after PTE treatment. In addition, treatment with PTE improved the relatively low Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio in the gut of high-fat diet-fed mice through enrichment of the Proteobacteria population and reduction of the Deferribacteres population. In conclusion, treatment with PTE inhibited lipid accumulation by inducing the expression of the master transcription factor PPARα, attenuated the low-grade chronic inflammation of obesity, and also altered gut microbiota profiles. These results indicate that PTE has the potential to be developed into an anti-obesity food supplement and therapy.

17925338,Adipose tissue lipin-1 expression is correlated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha gene expression and insulin sensitivity in healthy young men,"Abstract                        Context:                    Lipin-1 functions in adipocyte triglyceride biosynthesis and in the regulation of gene expression, both of which may influence metabolic homeostasis.              Objective:                    Our objective was to determine whether variations in adipose tissue lipin-1 expression levels influence insulin sensitivity and gene expression in young healthy human subjects.              Design and subjects:                    In 56 healthy young men (22.6 +/- 3.2 yr; 26.4 +/- 4.1 kg/m2) we determined insulin sensitivity by a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, and whole body oxygen consumption and respiratory quotient by indirect calorimetry. We performed gene expression analysis in adipose tissue samples from human subjects and from lipin-1 transgenic mice using quantitative RT-PCR.              Results:                    In healthy young men, lipin-1 expression was positively correlated with insulin sensitivity (R2 = 0.22; P < 0.01), insulin-stimulated respiratory quotient (R2 = 0.16; P < 0.01), and maximal oxygen consumption during exercise (R2 = 0.16; P < 0.01). Lipin-1 mRNA levels were also correlated with expression of genes involved in lipid oxidation, uptake, and lipolysis, both in humans and in lipin-1 transgenic mice. The strongest correlation occurred between lipin-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (R2 = 0.74; P < 1 x 10(-7)), a nuclear receptor with a key role in fatty acid oxidation.              Conclusion:                    Lipin-1 expression levels in adipose tissue of healthy young subjects and in mice are correlated with a favorable metabolic profile and expression of fatty acid oxidation genes."
19700688,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation and long-chain fatty acids alter lipogenic gene networks in bovine mammary epithelial cells to various extents,"Abstract:Several long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are natural ligands of nonruminant peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), which, along with its lipogenic target genes, is upregulated in bovine mammary tissue during lactation. Thus, PPARG might represent an important control point of bovine milk fat synthesis. We tested lipogenic gene network expression via quantitative PCR of 19 genes in bovine mammary epithelial cells cultured with 16:0, 18:0, cis-9 18:1, trans-10 18:1, trans-10,cis-12 18:2 [t10c12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)], 20:5, ethanol (control), and the PPARG agonist rosiglitazone (ROSI). Triplicate cultures were maintained for 12 h with 50 muM ROSI or 100 muM LCFA. Responses common to 16:0 and 18:0 relative to the control included significantly greater expression of INSIG1 (+298%, +92%), AGPAT6 (+137%, +169%), FABP3 (+755%, +338%), and FABP4 (+171%, 157%). These were coupled with greater intracellular lipid droplet formation and mRNA of ACSS2, LPIN1, SCD, and SREBF2 in response to 16:0, and greater DGAT1 and THRSP with 18:0. Trans-10 18:1 and t10c12 CLA reduced expression of FASN (-60%, -31%), SCD (-100%, -357%), and SREBF1 (-49%, -189%). Furthermore, t10c12 CLA downregulated ACSS2, FABP3, INSIG1, SREBF2, and THRSP expression. Expression of SREBF1 was lower with cis-9 18:1 (-140%) and 20:5 (-125%) compared with the control. This latter LCFA also decreased SCD, SREBF2, and LPL expression. No effects of LCFA or ROSI on PPARG were observed, but ROSI upregulated (+39% to +269%) expression of ACACA, FASN, LPIN1, AGPAT6, DGAT1, SREBF1, SREBF2, and INSIG1. Thus, these genes are putative PPARG target genes in bovine mammary cells. This is the first report showing a direct effect of trans-10 18:1 on bovine mammary cell lipogenic gene expression. The coordinated upregulation of lipogenic gene networks in response to ROSI and saturated LCFA offers support for PPARG activation in regulating bovine milk fat synthesis."
19389960,Long-chain fatty acid effects on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-regulated genes in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells: optimization of culture conditions using palmitate,"Abstract:Studying long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) effects on gene network expression in bovine cells could provide useful information for future practical applications. An optimized in vitro system that does not require tissue collection or cell isolation could fill a niche in the study of PPARalpha activity in ruminants. Specific aims were to optimize culture conditions in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells to achieve maximal mRNA expression of known peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) target genes using palmitate (16:0) as a representative LCFA. Variables included length of incubation time, use of albumin-bound (4:1 molar proportion) 16:0 (A16:0), or addition of insulin. A first time-course experiment tested culturing cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 150 microM PPAR ligand Wy-14643 (WY) and A16:0. A second experiment tested the effects of albumin and insulin using 150 microM of 16:0 without albumin or insulin (-Alb/-Ins), 16:0 without albumin plus 5 mg/L of bovine insulin (-Alb/+Ins), A16:0 without insulin (+Alb/-Ins), or a control. A third experiment was a preliminary metabolic characterization of cells and assessed intracellular lipid droplet formation after treatment with 150 microM of 16:0 or an ethanol control. For all experiments, cells were harvested at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h posttreatment. In experiments 1 and 2, mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative PCR of selected PPARalpha target genes as well as PPARalpha coactivators (ACOX1, CPT1A, ACADVL, ACSL1, PPARA, PPARGC1A, LPIN1). In experiment 1, there was a linear increase in mRNA expression of CPT1A (approximately 500%) and ACSL1 (50 to 200%) by 6 h of incubation with both WY and A16:0. The LPIN1 mRNA increased by >100% by 6 h only with A16:0. Further, there was a linear increase in expression of PPARA (approximately 100%) with A16:0 through 24 h of incubation. In experiment 2, insulin increased, and coupling LCFA with albumin tended to delay the response in expression of CPT1A and ACSL1 to 16:0. Data indicated a toxic effect of 150 microM free 16:0 as assessed by cell counts after 12 h of incubation. In experiment 3, MDBK cells appeared to use glucose and AA as energy sources and were able to secrete triglycerides. In addition, MDBK cells cultured with 150 microM of 16:0 had a substantial uptake of LCFA and synthesized intracellular lipid droplets. Overall, results indicated that a 6-h incubation with free LCFA and addition of insulin was suitable to detect marked effects on mRNA expression of PPARalpha target genes in MDBK cells."
17003347,Lipin expression is attenuated in adipose tissue of insulin-resistant human subjects and increases with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation,"Abstract:Lipin-alpha and -beta are the alternatively spliced gene products of the Lpin1 gene, whose product lipin is required for adipocyte differentiation. Lipin deficiency causes lipodystrophy, fatty liver, and insulin resistance in mice, whereas adipose tissue lipin overexpression results in increased adiposity but improved insulin sensitivity. To assess lipin expression and its relation to insulin resistance in humans, we examined lipin-alpha and -beta mRNA levels in subjects with normal or impaired glucose tolerance. We found higher expression levels of both lipin isoforms in lean, insulin-sensitive subjects. When compared with normal glucose-tolerant subjects, individuals with impaired glucose tolerance were more insulin resistant, demonstrated higher levels of intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs), and expressed approximately 50% lower levels of lipin-alpha and -beta. In addition, there was a strong inverse correlation between adipose tissue lipin expression and muscle IMCLs but no evidence for an increase in muscle lipid oxidation. After treatment of the impaired glucose-tolerant subjects with insulin sensitizers for 10 weeks, pioglitazone (but not metformin) resulted in a 60% increase in the insulin sensitivity index (Si) and a 32% decrease in IMCLs (both P < 0.01), along with an increase in lipin-beta (but not lipin-alpha) expression by 200% (P < 0.005). Lipin expression in skeletal muscle, however, was not related to obesity or insulin resistance. Hence, high adipose tissue lipin expression is found in insulin-sensitive subjects, and lipin-beta expression increases following treatment with pioglitazone. These results suggest that increased adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis in subcutaneous fat, mediated by the LPIN1 gene, may prevent lipotoxicity in muscle, leading to improved insulin sensitivity."
17563064,Hepatic lipin 1beta expression is diminished in insulin-resistant obese subjects and is reactivated by marked weight loss,"Abstract                        Objective:                    Lipin 1 plays critical roles in controlling energy metabolism. We sought to determine the expression of lipin 1 isoforms (lipin 1alpha and -beta) in liver and adipose tissue of obese subjects and to evaluate cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of lipin 1 expression by physiologic stimuli.              Research design and methods:                    The expression of lipin 1alpha and -beta was quantified in liver and adipose tissue of extremely obese (average BMI 60.8 kg/m(2)) human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GBS). Second, the expression of lipin 1 was evaluated in HepG2 cells in response to overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha under normal or hyperinsulinemic conditions.              Results:                    The expression of lipin 1beta in liver and adipose tissue was inversely related to BMI, fasting plasma insulin concentration, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance but was significantly increased by marked weight loss and insulin sensitization following GBS. Hepatic lipin 1beta mRNA levels were strongly correlated with the expression of PGC-1alpha, and overexpression of PGC-1alpha in HepG2 cells increased lipin 1 expression. Conversely, hyperinsulinemic culture conditions downregulated the expression of lipin 1beta, PGC-1alpha, and their known target genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism in HepG2 cells. Finally, overexpression of lipin 1beta or PGC-1alpha reversed the effect of hyperinsulinemia on the expression of their target genes.              Conclusions:                    These studies suggest that hepatic lipin 1beta and PGC-1alpha expression are downregulated by obesity and obesity-related metabolic perturbations in human subjects, likely due to alterations in insulin concentration or sensitivity."
19925655,Gene network and pathway analysis of bovine mammary tissue challenged with Streptococcus uberis reveals induction of cell proliferation and inhibition of PPARgamma signaling as potential mechanism for the negative relationships between immune response and lipid metabolism,"Abstract                        Background:                    Information generated via microarrays might uncover interactions between the mammary gland and Streptococcus uberis (S. uberis) that could help identify control measures for the prevention and spread of S. uberis mastitis, as well as improve overall animal health and welfare, and decrease economic losses to dairy farmers. The main objective of this study was to determine the most affected gene networks and pathways in mammary tissue in response to an intramammary infection (IMI) with S. uberis and relate these with other physiological measurements associated with immune and/or metabolic responses to mastitis challenge with S. uberis O140J.              Results:                    Streptococcus uberis IMI resulted in 2,102 (1,939 annotated) differentially expressed genes (DEG). Within this set of DEG, we uncovered 20 significantly enriched canonical pathways (with 20 to 61 genes each), the majority of which were signaling pathways. Among the most inhibited were LXR/RXR Signaling and PPARalpha/RXRalpha Signaling. Pathways activated by IMI were IL-10 Signaling and IL-6 Signaling which likely reflected counter mechanisms of mammary tissue to respond to infection. Of the 2,102 DEG, 1,082 were up-regulated during IMI and were primarily involved with the immune response, e.g., IL6, TNF, IL8, IL10, SELL, LYZ, and SAA3. Genes down-regulated (1,020) included those associated with milk fat synthesis, e.g., LPIN1, LPL, CD36, and BTN1A1. Network analysis of DEG indicated that TNF had positive relationships with genes involved with immune system function (e.g., CD14, IL8, IL1B, and TLR2) and negative relationships with genes involved with lipid metabolism (e.g., GPAM, SCD, FABP4, CD36, and LPL) and antioxidant activity (SOD1).              Conclusion:                    Results provided novel information into the early signaling and metabolic pathways in mammary tissue that are associated with the innate immune response to S. uberis infection. Our study indicated that IMI challenge with S. uberis (strain O140J) elicited a strong transcriptomic response, leading to potent activation of pro-inflammatory pathways that were associated with a marked inhibition of lipid synthesis, stress-activated kinase signaling cascades, and PPAR signaling (most likely PPARgamma). This latter effect may provide a mechanistic explanation for the inverse relationship between immune response and milk fat synthesis."
19936100,Genomic loci modulating the retinal transcriptome in wound healing,"Abstract                        Purpose:                    The present study predicts and tests genetic networks that modulate gene expression during the retinal wound-healing response.              Methods:                    Upstream modulators and target genes were defined using meta-analysis and bioinformatic approaches. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for retinal acute phase genes (Vazquez-Chona et al. 2005) were defined using QTL analysis of CNS gene expression (Chesler et al. 2005). Candidate modulators were defined using computational analysis of gene and motif sequences. The effect of candidate genes on wound healing was tested using animal models of gene expression.              Results:                    A network of early wound-healing genes is modulated by a locus on chromosome 12. The genetic background of the locus altered the wound-healing response of the retina. The C57BL/6 allele conferred enhanced expression of neuronal marker Thy1 and heat-shock-like crystallins, whereas the DBA/2J allele correlated with greater levels of the classic marker of retinal stress, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Id2 and Lpin1 are candidate upstream modulators as they strongly correlated with the segregation of DBA/2J and C57BL/6 alleles, and their dosage levels correlated with the enhanced expression of survival genes (Thy1 and crystallin genes).              Conclusion:                    We defined a genetic network associated with the retinal acute injury response. Using genetic linkage analysis of natural transcript variation, we identified regulatory loci and can didate modulators that control transcript levels of acute phase genes. Our results support the convergence of gene expression profiling, QTL analysis, and bioinformatics as a rational approach to discover molecular pathways controlling retinal wound healing.

16868072,"Trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid causes inflammation and delipidation of white adipose tissue in mice: a microarray and histological analysis","Abstract:A combined histological and microarray analysis of the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) was performed to better define functional responses. Mice fed t10c12 CLA for 14 days lost 85% of WAT mass, 95% of adipocyte lipid droplet volume, and 15 or 47% of the number of adipocytes and total cells, respectively. Microarray profiling of replicated pools (n = 2 per day x diet) of control and treated mice (n = 140) at seven time points after 1-17 days of t10c12 CLA feeding found between 2,682 and 4,216 transcript levels changed by twofold or more. Transcript levels for genes involved in glucose and fatty acid import or biosynthesis were significantly reduced. Highly expressed transcripts for lipases were significantly reduced but still abundant. Increased levels of mRNAs for two key thermogenesis proteins, uncoupling protein 1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, may have increased energy expenditures. Significant reductions of mRNAs for major adipocyte regulatory factors, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, sterol regulatory binding protein 1, CAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha, and lipin 1 were correlated with the reduced transcript levels for key metabolic pathways in the WAT. A prolific inflammation response was indicated by the 2- to 100-fold induction of many cytokine transcripts, including those for IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF ligands, and CXC family members, and an increased density of macrophages. The mRNA changes suggest that a combination of cell loss, increased energy expenditure, and residual transport of lipids out of the adipocytes may account for the cumulative mass loss observed."
23862673,Assembly of high molecular weight complexes of lipin on a supported lipid bilayer observed by atomic force microscopy,"Abstract:Lipins are phosphatidic acid phosphatases involved in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. They are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum but can also travel into the nucleus and alter gene expression. Previous studies indicate lipins in solution form high molecular weight complexes, possibly tetramers. This study was undertaken to determine if lipins form complexes on membranes as well. Murine lipin 1b was applied to a supported bilayer of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol and examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) over time. Lipin on bare mica appeared as a symmetric particle with a volume consistent with the size of a monomer. On the bilayer, lipin initially bound as asymmetric, curved particles that sometimes assembled into circular structures with an open center. Subsequently, lipin assemblies grew into large, symmetric particles with an average volume 12 times that of the monomer. Over time, some of the lipin assemblies were removed from the bilayer by the AFM probe leaving behind ""footprints"" composed of complex patterns that may reflect the substructure of the lipin assemblies. The lipin complexes appeared very flat, with a diameter 20 times their height. The footprints had a similar diameter, providing confirmation of the extensive deformation of the protein under the AFM probe. The ability of lipin to form large complexes on membranes may have significant implications for the local concentrations of the product, diacylglycerol, formed during hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid and for cooperative hormonal regulation of lipin activity through phosphorylation of one or more monomers in the complexes."
